Why is Python so slow to compute 99999 ** 99999?

Python is not slow to compute 99999**99999 if you just store it into a variable.

It’s fairly slow to print the number out in decimal form, because that requires converting a number with
1,660,946 bits into 499,995 decimal digits. That’s a bunch of dividing by 10 (or powers of 10, assuming some
basic optimization).

However, printing the number out in hexadecimal form is quite fast. This is because printing out a 1,660,496
bit number in hexadecimal requires no divisions at all, just grouping of bits and translating to characters.

On my PC, printing the number in decimal took 3.05 seconds. Printing it in hexadecimal took 0.07 seconds.
