Why are mathematicians so obsessed with proofs? Many theorems are just intuitive.

Here's the example I usually give: "The square of an odd number is an odd number." Obvious and intuitive, right?
Now try to prove it. The process goes something like this:

"What's a odd number?"
	"It's a number that isn't divisible by 2."

"Wait, aren't all numbers divisible by 2? Like 5 divided by 2 is 2.5."
	"No, it's an integer not divisible by 2."

"What do you mean by that?"
	"When you divide it, you have a remainder."

"How can you tell?"
	[some thought, ending with]

"OK, if an integer is not divisible by k, then it has the form pk + r, where k is an integer and r is a
whole number less than k.

"So an odd number is a number of the form 2k + 1, where k is an integer."

Now at this point, notice you have to define what you mean by an odd number, and have to clarify notions
like "not divisible by." In other words, proof CREATES mathematics.

"Now we square it: (2k + 1)^2 = 4k^2 + 4k + 1 = 2(2k^2 + 2k) + 1", so it's odd.

"Hey wait a minute...that 4k^2 + 4k + 1, that's 4(k^2 + k) +1, isn't it?"

"Huh...that means the square of an odd number always has remainder 1 when divided by 4."

"Hey, that means we know that numbers like 1000000003 can't be squares, since that leaves remainder 3...."

Here's the other feature of proof: it leads you to discover things you might not have known about.
