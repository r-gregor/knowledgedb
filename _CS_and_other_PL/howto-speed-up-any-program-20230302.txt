Here are some tips you can use to speed up any program:

- Do memoizing/caching - instead of calculating the same value over and over again, save it and simply
  recall it from memory later.

- Do batch IO - instead of writing/reading character by character or line by line, store them in memory and
  then read/write a bunch of characters or lines at the same time.

- Use faster algorithms - instead of using brute force, use tree search, use dictionaries/hashes/array
  indices for faster access. Aim for smaller values of big-o.
