How to Install KVM on Ubuntu 24.04 Step-by-Step
October 14, 2024

   Hello Readers, in this blog post, we will show you how to install KVM on Ubuntu 24.04 step-by-step.

   Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) is a powerful virtualization technology built into Linux. It
   allows you to create and manage multiple virtual machines (VMs) on your Ubuntu 24.04 system. Follow
   this step-by-step guide to install KVM and get started with virtualization on your Linux server.

Prerequisites
     * Pre-Install Ubuntu 24.04 Instance (Server or Desktop)
     * A local user with sudo rights.
     * Stable Internet Connection
     * Ensure that your system supports virtualization. You can verify this by checking if your CPU has
       the necessary virtualization extensions (Intel VT or AMD-V) and if they are enabled in the BIOS.

   Note: To enable the Virtualization, you need to go to bios settings of your system and enable Intel
   VT or AMD-V.

   Check for Virtualization Support
$> egrep -c '(vmx|svm)' /proc/cpuinfo

   If the output is more than 0, your CPU supports virtualization.

1) Update the System
   It is highly recommended, start by updating your package list to ensure you have the latest versions.
   Run the following command from the terminal.
$> sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y

2) Install KVM and Related Packages
   KVM and its related packages are available in the default apt repository of Ubuntu 24.04, so for its
   installation, run
$> sudo apt install qemu-kvm libvirt-daemon-system libvirt-clients bridge-utils virt-manager -y

   This command installs KVM, QEMU, virt-mamager and other tools required to manage virtual machines.
   After the installation of above packages, start libvirtd service.

3)  Start and Enable Libvirtd service
   Start and enable the libvirtd service using following systemctl command.
$> sudo systemctl enable --now libvirtd

   Next, check libvirtd service status. If the service is active and running, your installation was
   successful.

4) Add Your Local User to the KVM and Libvirt Group
   For non-root users to manage virtual machines, add your user to the `libvirt` and `kvm` groups:
$> sudo usermod -aG libvirt,kvm $USER

   Log out and log back in for these changes to take effect.

5) Create Network Bridge using netplan
   To access KVM virtual machines from outside your Ubuntu 24.04 system, you need to map the VM's
   interface to a network bridge. While KVM creates a default virtual bridge called virbr0 for testing,
   it's not suitable for external connections. To set up a proper network bridge, you should create a
   configuration file with extension *.yaml in the /etc/netplan directory. This configuration ensures
   that your VMs can communicate with other devices on the network efficiently.
$> cd /etc/netplan/
$> ls
50-cloud-init.yaml

   Note : This file name may vary according to your setup but extension will be yaml. Modify this file and add
   the following content to it.
$> sudo vi 50-cloud-init.yaml
network:
	renderer: NetworkManager
	ethernets:
		enp0s3:
			dhcp4: false
			dhcp6: false
	# add configuration for bridge interface
	bridges:
		br0:
			interfaces: [enp0s3]
			dhcp4: false
			addresses: [192.168.1.4/24]
			macaddress: 08:00:27:11:3c:a4
			routes:
				- to: default
					via: 192.168.1.1
					metric: 100
			nameservers:
				addresses: [4.2.2.2]
			parameters:
				stp: false
			dhcp6: false
	version: 2

   Save and close the file.
   Note : Change Interface Name, its macaddress, IP details that suits to your setup.

   Apply these changes so that they comes into the affect, run
$> sudo netplan apply

   Now, run 'ip add show' command to verify the bridge and ip details.
$> ip add show
$> ip route show

   Great, output above confirms that we have successfully created a network bridge named br0 and has
   assigned a static IP address to it. Interface for the bridge is 'enp0s3'.

6) Launch Virt-Manager and Create virtual Machine
   Virt-Manager is a graphical interface that makes it easier to create and manage virtual machines. You can
   now create and manage your VMs through a user-friendly interface.
     * Open Virt-Manager and click on "Create a New Virtual Machine."
     * Follow the prompts to specify the installation source, disk space, memory, and CPU settings for
       your new VM.
     * Complete the setup and start your new virtual machine.

   Create VM Using Virt-Manager
   Alternate way to create virtual machine is from the command line using virt-install command. This is
   mostly used on Ubuntu servers where we don't have desktop environment.

Creating Virtual Machine from Command Line
Use the virt-install command to create a VM, as shown below.
$> sudo virt-install \
--name RockLinuxVM \
--ram 1024 \
--vcpus 2 \
--disk path=/var/lib/libvirt/images/rocklinuxvm.img,size=10 \
--os-variant rocky9 \
--network bridge=br0 \
--graphics vnc,listen=0.0.0.0 \
--cdrom /home/linuxtechi/Rocky-9.3-x86_64-minimal.iso

   Note: Adjust these parameters that suits to your setup.

   Now start the VNC viewer and connect it your Ubuntu 24.04 on port 5900, as shown below. Follow the screen
   instructions and complete the installation.

   That's all from this post, I believe you have found these instructions useful. Feel free to ask if
   you need further details or assistance with your KVM setup!
