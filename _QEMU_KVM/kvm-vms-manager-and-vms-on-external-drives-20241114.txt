KVM Virtual Machine Manager and Virtual Machines on external drives

Last year, I blogged about my [16]first experiences with KVM and Virtual Machine Manager.

Then, I stopped using [17]KVM because I've always found [18]VirtualBox easier for my experiments. In
particular, with VirtualBox, it is trivial to store virtual machines on an external drive (I mean, a
fast external SD, of course): you specify to use a directory on the external drive, and all
information about the virtual machine will be stored there. Then, you attach the drive to another
computer with VirtualBox and open the virtual machine from the external drive. Easy!

Things are more complicated with KVM, QEMU, and Virtual Machine Manager. Even making QEMU access an
external drive requires additional configuration steps.

In this blog post, I'll summarize the steps to achieve that.

I'll first show the manual export/import procedure for the machines' metadata information. Then, I'll
show a different approach based on symlinks.

It was time to try KVM again because it's faster than VirtualBox.

I'll describe the installation steps for EndeavourOS and pure Arch Linux. I guess the steps for other
distributions are similar.

Installation and configuration
Let's install a few packages for KVM, QEMU, and the Virtual Machine Manager:
$> sudo pacman -S --needed virt-manager qemu-base libvirt edk2-ovmf dnsmasq vde2 bridge-utils iptables-nft dmidecode

If you get this message, accept to remove "iptables":
iptables-nft and iptables are in conflict. Remove iptables? [y/N]

To use your user without entering the root password, we need to edit the file
"/etc/libvirt/libvirtd.conf" and uncomment the following lines:
unix_sock_group = "libvirt"
unix_sock_rw_perms = "0770"

Or, append them at the end of the file:
$> sudo tee -a /etc/libvirt/libvirtd.conf > /dev/null <<EOT
unix_sock_group = "libvirt"
unix_sock_rw_perms = "0770"
EOT

Add your user account to the "libvirt" group.
$> sudo usermod -a -G libvirt $(whoami)

Now comes the crucial part for letting QEMU handle machines on external drives: we need to add our
user to "/etc/libvirt/qemu.conf". This can be done by setting the appropriate entries in the file or
by simply appending the entries at the end of the file:
$> sudo tee -a /etc/libvirt/qemu.conf > /dev/null <<EOT
user = "$(whoami)"
group = "$(whoami)"
EOT

If you want to start the virtualization service and the default virtual network automatically at
boot, you run:
$> sudo systemctl enable libvirtd.service
$> sudo virsh net-autostart default

Since I'm not using virtual machines daily, I prefer to start them when needed, so I don't run the
above commands. Of course, I must remember to run these commands (note, for the network is "start"
instead of "autostart") before starting the "Virtual Machine Manager":
$> sudo systemctl start libvirtd.service
$> sudo virsh net-start default

Remember you can always use:
$> systemctl status libvirtd.service

to see the service status and possible errors shown when running this command.
OK, time to reboot now.

Let's create a virtual machine on an external drive
I created a directory "kvm/images" on my external USB SD to store the virtual machine images.
Let's start the "Virtual Machine Manager" program. We should see "QEMU/KVM":
Let's create a new virtual machine with the leftmost toolbar button.
I specify a local ISO.
I don't create a pool for ISOs and use "Browse Local" to select an ISO in my external drive.

In this example, I will install EndeavourOS on the virtual machine. I have to select the operating
system manually (start typing, and you get completions):
Time to allocate resources for the virtual machine. I'm giving the VM half my RAM and half my cores:
Now here's the essential part of disk selection. Remember, I want to use my external drive, so I
select custom storage and press "Manage":
In the following dialog, I use the "+" button in the bottom left corner to create a new pool:
I give the pool the name "images" and specify the directory I mentioned above on my external drive:
After pressing "Finish", I select the created pool and add a "Volume" (with the other "+" button)
I give the disk image a proper name and enough size (recall that the image will NOT allocate all the
size immediately, but only on-demand):
Select the volume and press "Choose Volume":
On the final dialog, make sure the default network is selected and that you check "Customize
configuration before install" (note that I also changed the name for the virtual machine):
Let's press "Finish," and get to the configuration dialog. I changed the Firmware from "BIOS" to
"UEFI", pressed "Apply," and finally, we can start the installation with "Begin Installation".

We should not get any error from QEMU because it cannot access the external drive, thanks to the
configuration shown above in the qemu.conf file!

After the GRUB menu, we should see the installer log:
And then, the EndeavourOS installer dialog:
Since [19]I've already blogged about EndeavourOS installation, I'll skip the detailed steps. I'll
install the GNOME desktop environment and let the installer use the whole disk space with the BTRFS
filesystem and SWAP with hibernate (later, I might want to check whether hibernate works in the VM).

In a few minutes, the installation finishes! We get to the GRUB menu of the installed system:
And to the installed GNOME desktop:
The disk image is correctly created in the external drive:
$> ll /run/media/bettini/VMs/kvm/images
.rw------- 54G bettini 3 mar 17:46  endeavour-kvm-gnome.qcow2

And the information about the virtual machine is in the:
/etc/libvirt/qemu
+-- autostart
+-- networks
| +-- autostart
| | +--  default.xml -> /etc/libvirt/qemu/networks/default.xml
| +--  default.xml
+--  eos-kvm-gnome.xml

Export the virtual machine
First, let's shut down the machine.

Let's export the virtual machine to use it from another computer. I understand that having the same
software on the other host is crucial. Since I'm using EndeavourOS or Arch on my main computers, that
is not a problem.

But isn't the virtual machine already in an external drive? Why do I have to export it?

That's the main difference with VirtualBox I mentioned at the beginning. The disk image is on an
external drive, but the virtual machine information (configuration and metadata) is on a local XML
file (see the listing of "/etc/libvirt/qemu" above; the XML file of the virtual machine is
"eos-kvm-gnome.xml", after the name I gave to the virtual machine when I created it).

Remember that the XML has an absolute path pointing to the disk image on the external drive:

<source file='/run/media/bettini/VMs/kvm/images/endeavour-kvm-gnome.qcow2'/>

So, again, in the other computers, the mount point of the external drive must be the same; otherwise,
the absolute path must be manually adapted.

We could copy the XML file directly on the external drive (somewhere near the disk image to be easily
found), e.g.:
$> sudo cp /etc/libvirt/qemu/eos-kvm-gnome.xml /run/media/bettini/VMs/kvm

Alternatively, if we don't remember the location of the XML file, we can use the "dump" command.

For example, we can first list the current machines (in the example, I have only one):
$> sudo virsh list --all
Id   Name            State
--------------------------------
-    eos-kvm-gnome   shut off

And then, we dump its XML configuration:
$> sudo virsh dumpxml eos-kvm-gnome > /run/media/bettini/VMs/kvm/eos-kvm-gnome.xml

We're ready to import and use the VM on another computer

Import the virtual machine
I have already installed and configured KVM on another computer, following the same procedure at the
beginning of the post.

Since I haven't enabled the services at boot time, I run the following:
$> sudo systemctl start libvirtd.service
$> sudo virsh net-start default

I connect the external drive and ensure it's mounted (remember, on the same mount point as in the
other computer).

Then, I create the virtual machine information locally by using the XML file on the drive I created
above:
$> sudo virsh define /run/media/bettini/VMs/kvm/eos-kvm-gnome.xml
Domain 'eos-kvm-gnome' defined from /run/media/bettini/VMs/kvm/eos-kvm-gnome.xml

We can verify that the XML is now in the directory of QEMU:
$> ls -l /etc/libvirt/qemu/
total 8
drwxr-xr-x 1 root root 0 16 gen 20.56 autostart
-rw------- 1 root root 7693 4 mar 17.51 eos-kvm-gnome.xml
drwxr-xr-x 1 root root 40 4 mar 17.27 networks

Let's start "Virtual Machine Manager," and we can see the virtual machine:
We can start it, and it should work as on the other computer.

Cloning and Snapshots
Let's create a clone of this virtual machine, e.g., with the context menu of the machine in the main
user interface.

The destination path is based on the path of the current machine, the external drive, which is good.

Let's wait for the clone to finish, and then we have two virtual machines:

If I want this clone to be usable on other computers, I repeat the export procedure for this new
virtual machine:
$> sudo virsh list --all
Id   Name                  State
--------------------------------------
-    eos-kvm-gnome         shut off
-    eos-kvm-gnome-clone   shut off

$> sudo virsh dumpxml eos-kvm-gnome-clone > /run/media/bettini/VMs/kvm/eos-kvm-gnome-clone.xml

I'll leave this clone virtual machine as it is for now, and I'll create a snapshot in the other
virtual machine, the original one.

Snapshot information is stored somewhere else, NOT in the XML of the virtual machine:
$> ll /var/lib/libvirt/qemu/snapshot/eos-kvm-gnome
.rw------- 8,4k root  4 mar 18:39 謹 snapshot1.xml

So we need them as well if we want to use them on another computer.
$> sudo virsh snapshot-list --name eos-kvm-gnome
snapshot1

$> sudo virsh snapshot-dumpxml --domain eos-kvm-gnome --snapshotname snapshot1 > /run/media/bettini/VMs/kvm/eos-kvm-gnome-snapshot1.xml

To add the snapshot to the other computer, I have to run:
$> sudo virsh snapshot-create --redefine eos-kvm-gnome /run/media/bettini/VMs/kvm/eos-kvm-gnome-snapshot1.xml
Domain snapshot snapshot1 created from '/run/media/bettini/VMs/kvm/eos-kvm-gnome-snapshot1.xml'

$> ll /var/lib/libvirt/qemu/snapshot/eos-kvm-gnome
.rw------- 8,4k root  4 mar 20:27 謹 snapshot1.xml

However, keep in mind that if you try to start a snapshot, you get this warning:

So if you don't want to lose the current state, create another snapshot for the current state before
restoring a previous one. Moreover, if the snapshot's state is "Shutoff", "starting" the snapshot
only restores it. Then, you must start the virtual machine.

A different approach: symlinks
In the previous sections, I showed how machine information (including snapshots) and images could be
put on external drives. Besides the machine images residing on external drives from the beginning,
the machine metadata is still on your hard disk. In fact, you must first export them (e.g., on the
external drive) and then import them on another computer.

A more radical approach consists of keeping the metadata on the external drive only and creating
symlinks in each computer's libvirt/qemu directories.

On the first computer, the XML files of machine information and snapshots have to be copied onto the
external drive. IMPORTANT: don't dump information as we did above; you need to copy the original XML
files themselves. Dumping does not generate the exact XML files stored on the libvirt/qemu
directories. In fact, as shown above, the dumped XML files must be imported with dedicated commands.

In my case, on the first computer, I run:
$> sudo cp -a /etc/libvirt/qemu /run/media/bettini/VMs/kvm/
$> sudo cp -a /var/lib/libvirt/qemu/snapshot /run/media/bettini/VMs/kvm/

So, on the external drive, I end up with these contents:

$> tree /run/media/bettini/VMs/kvm
/run/media/bettini/VMs/kvm
+-- images
|   +-- endeavour-kvm-gnome-clone.qcow2
|   +-- endeavour-kvm-gnome.qcow2
+-- qemu
|   +-- autostart
|   +-- eos-kvm-gnome-clone.xml
|   +-- eos-kvm-gnome.xml
|   +-- networks
|       +-- autostart
|       +-- default.xml
+-- snapshot
   +-- eos-kvm-gnome
	   +-- snapshot1.xml

On the same computer, I run the following commands (make sure the "libvirtd.service" is not running):
$> sudo rm -rf /etc/libvirt/qemu
$> sudo ln -s /run/media/bettini/VMs/kvm/qemu /etc/libvirt

$> sudo rm -rf /var/lib/libvirt/qemu/snapshot
$> sudo mkdir -p /var/lib/libvirt/qemu
$> sudo ln -s /run/media/bettini/VMs/kvm/snapshot /var/lib/libvirt/qemu/

Now, I can start the "libvirtd.service" and the default network, and I make sure I can still access
all my machines stored on the external drive, including all the machine information.

Of course, if you have never created virtual machines and want to start creating them on the external
drive, it is enough to run the above commands. Then, start creating machines. Remember to select the
external drive for the image location.

Then, on the other computers where I have already installed the same software for KVM, QEMU, etc., I
first ensure the "libvirtd.service" is not running (in case stop it). Then, I connect my external
drive and run the above commands (these will remove possible existing machines' information, so be
careful).

Of course, the above commands must be run only the first time.

Now, I can start the "libvirtd.service" and the default network, and I can access all my machines
stored on the external drive, including all the machine information. Every modification (an image
content or a machine configuration) will be stored on the external drive.

This approach works if you want to store ALL your machines on the external drive. You won't have to
keep the information in sync because they are stored in a single place.

If you need to keep some machines on your computers and others on different external drives, you must
use the above-shown manual procedure for exporting and importing. It is then up to you to remember to
re-export/re-import if you change a machine's configuration or a snapshot.
