Rust Is A Great Programming Language For Building CLI Tools
3/30/2023

   Although I have "started learning Rust" a few times I always had to at the end of the day go back to
   working on JavaScript / TypeScript stuff at work which was fine, but it was really just that I
   learned to live with how switch / case worked, how if blocks were just statements and not
   expressions, the null problem, 0.1 + 0.2 not being correct, etc... Now that I'm a free agent I've
   had a lot of time to play around with Rust and build some little command line tools, and honestly, I
   think it is a really good exercise for every aspiring rustacean! I think blog post I'll expand more
   on why I feel this way...

What Is Rust?
   Rust is a programming language that has been gaining popularity in recent years, and for good reason.
   It has many features that make it an excellent choice for building command-line utilities.

   One of the main reasons why Rust is so popular is its speed and performance. Rust is a compiled
   language, which means that the code is compiled into machine code that can run directly on the
   hardware. This makes Rust programs extremely fast and efficient.

   In addition, Rust's memory management system ensures that programs are free from memory-related bugs
   such as buffer overflows and null pointer exceptions. This makes Rust a very reliable and safe choice
   for building command-line utilities.

Speed & Performance
   Rust's speed and performance are some of its most notable features, and they make it an excellent
   choice for building command-line utilities.

   One reason why Rust is so fast is its unique ownership and borrowing system. This system allows Rust
   to avoid some of the overhead associated with garbage collection in other programming languages, such
   as Java or Python. Instead, Rust manages memory through a system of ownership and borrowing, which
   ensures that memory is freed as soon as it is no longer needed. This allows Rust programs to be more
   efficient and to use less memory than programs written in other languages.

   In addition, Rust's memory safety guarantees make it easier to write high-performance code without
   introducing memory-related bugs. Rust's ownership system ensures that memory is accessed safely and
   that there are no null pointer exceptions or buffer overflows. This means that Rust programs are not
   only fast but also safe and reliable.

   Another reason why Rust is so fast is its excellent support for concurrency. Rust's ownership and
   borrowing system makes it easy to write concurrent code that can take advantage of multiple cores and
   processors. Rust provides several concurrency primitives, such as threads and channels, that allow
   developers to write high-performance, concurrent code without having to worry about the low-level
   details of thread management and synchronization.

   Rust's ability to generate efficient machine code is another reason why it is so fast. Rust's
   compiler is designed to generate highly optimized machine code, which means that Rust programs can
   take full advantage of the underlying hardware. This makes Rust a great choice for building
   high-performance command-line utilities that need to handle large amounts of data or perform complex
   computations.

   Rust's speed and performance are some of its most compelling features, and they make it an excellent
   choice for building command-line utilities. Rust's ownership and borrowing system, memory safety
   guarantees, support for concurrency, and efficient machine code generation all contribute to its
   impressive performance. If you're looking to build a fast and efficient command-line utility, Rust is
   definitely worth considering.

   Sometimes the most valuable thing to a company is the developers' time, and not having to boot up a
   garbage collector or virtual machine compared to other programming languages saves a slight amount of
   time every time a command is run by every person using your custom cli tool.

Great Ecosystem
   One of the great strengths of Rust is its rich and growing ecosystem of libraries and tools. This
   ecosystem makes it easy to build powerful and feature-rich command-line utilities quickly and
   efficiently.

   At the heart of the Rust ecosystem is Cargo, the Rust package manager. Cargo makes it easy to manage
   dependencies, build projects, and publish libraries and executables. With Cargo, Rust developers can
   easily find and use libraries written by others, or publish their own libraries for others to use.

   One of the most popular Rust libraries for building command-line utilities is Clap. Clap is a
   powerful and flexible command-line argument parser that makes it easy to define and parse
   command-line arguments. With Clap, developers can easily handle complex argument structures, define
   flags and options, and even generate help and usage information for their utilities.

   Another popular library for building command-line utilities is Termion. Termion is a library for
   working with terminal input and output, providing an easy-to-use interface for cursor movement, color
   formatting, and other terminal-specific functionality.

   In addition to libraries, the Rust ecosystem also includes many other tools and utilities for
   building command-line applications. For example, Rustfmt is a tool for formatting Rust code according
   to a set of community standards, making it easy to maintain clean and readable code. Rustdoc is a
   tool for generating documentation from Rust code, making it easy to create user-friendly
   documentation for your command-line utilities. And Clippy is a Rust linter that catches common
   mistakes and gives suggestions to improve your Rust code.

   The Rust community is very active and supportive, with many resources available for learning and
   getting help with Rust. The Rust subreddit and Discord channel are great places to ask questions and
   get advice, while the Rust documentation and Rust by Example websites provide comprehensive and
   beginner-friendly resources for learning Rust.

Compiles To Cross-Platform Machine Code
   Rust's cross-platform capabilities make it easy to build command-line utilities that run on multiple
   operating systems, including macOS, Windows, and Linux.

   One of the main reasons why Rust is so portable is that it compiles to native machine code, which
   means that the resulting executable can run directly on the target system without needing any special
   runtime or virtual machine. This is in contrast to languages like Java or Python, which require a
   separate runtime or virtual machine to be installed on the target system.

   Rust's cross-platform capabilities are further enhanced by its excellent standard library, which
   provides a rich set of abstractions and APIs for working with the file system, networking, and other
   operating system services. The standard library is implemented in a platform-independent way, which
   means that Rust code written on one platform can easily be compiled and run on another platform.
   In addition, Rust's package manager, Cargo, provides built-in support for cross-compilation. This
   means that you can use Cargo to build your Rust command-line utility for a different target platform
   than the one you are currently running on. For example, you can use Cargo to build a Windows
   executable on a macOS machine, or a Linux executable on a Windows machine.

   Another advantage of Rust's cross-platform capabilities is that it makes it easy to distribute and
   share command-line utilities with others. Because Rust executables are self-contained and do not
   require any special runtime or virtual machine, they can be easily packaged and distributed as
   standalone binaries. This makes it easy to share Rust command-line utilities with users on different
   operating systems, without having to worry about compatibility issues.

   Rust's cross-platform capabilities make it easy to build command-line utilities that run on multiple
   operating systems, including macOS, Windows, and Linux. With its native machine code compilation,
   rich standard library, and built-in support for cross-compilation, Rust is an excellent choice for
   developers who want to build portable and platform-independent command-line utilities.

A Great Way To Learn Rust
   Many people find the complexity of Rust syntax and the borrow checker to be very daunting, and sadly
   this paralysis prevents them from ever getting to experience the joy of making something cool with
   Rust! In my opinion, creating command line tools is an excellent way to get a grasp of the language
   and experiment with different libraries on a very small scale, low-stakes environment. There are
   several reasons why building command-line utilities is a great way to learn and build confidence
   coding in Rust, for example:
    1. Small scope: Command-line utilities are typically small projects that do one thing well. This
       makes them a great way to practice Rust programming without getting overwhelmed by a large
       codebase or complex project requirements.
    2. Real-world applications: Command-line utilities are often used in real-world scenarios, which
       means that building them provides an opportunity to learn how to solve practical problems with
       Rust. This can be a great way to build your confidence and competence as a Rust developer.
    3. Immediate feedback: With command-line utilities, you can quickly see the results of your code
       changes by running the utility and seeing the output. This provides immediate feedback on the
       correctness and effectiveness of your code, which can be very motivating.
    4. Low barrier to entry: Building command-line utilities requires only basic knowledge of Rust
       syntax and some familiarity with the standard library. This makes it a great way for beginners to
       get started with Rust programming.
    5. Fun and creative: Building command-line utilities can be a fun and creative way to practice Rust
       programming, as you can choose projects that interest you and solve problems that you find
       personally relevant.

Some Inspiration...
   Here are a few great examples of command-line utility projects you can try to build:
     * A tool for calculating the average, median, and mode of a list of numbers
     * A tool for generating strong passwords
     * A tool for downloading files from the internet
     * A tool for parsing and analyzing log files

   Overall, building command-line utilities is a great way to learn and build confidence coding in Rust.
