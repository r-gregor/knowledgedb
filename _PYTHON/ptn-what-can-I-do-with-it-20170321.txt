   The other two answers focus on tools and frameworks you can use, but I’d suggest that you get down
   basic data structure and algorithmic concepts before getting into things like app development,
   networking, security, etc. The concepts in data structures and algorithms will help you immensely
   when using tools and frameworks and they’re language agnostic, so you can use those concepts whether
   you’re developing in Java, C++, JavaScript, etc. If you need a starting point, check out [11]my guide
   on data structures and algorithms.

   I would be worried that someone says they know Python - I have been using it for 7 years - and i
   don’t know every single standard library, all of it’s classes, functions, methods etc.

   Ignoring for a moment the 3rd party libraries - you might want to ensure that you are reasonably
   confident with :
     * Extending existing classes & adding new methods, overriding or extending existing methods
     * Implementing custom classes - including operators
     * Influencing how your classes are created - metaclasses
     * Regular expressions
     * Using os and os.path to explore and manipulate the machine you are executing on.
     * Manipulating datetimes and calendars
     * using heaps, queues & arrays
     * string manipulation and translations
     * Dealing with config files
     * Logging
     * Command line interfaces with arguments, options and flags
     * Object storage and persistance
     * Executing sql against RDMS
     * Building console based UIs
     * Building GUIs
     * Multi threading and multi processing inc inter process communications
     * handling http and email data (sending and receiving)

   Once you are confident with most of the above (all of which are delivered by default with Python),
   then you might want to look at :
     * Requests Library - a better way to get data from the internet
     * Beautiful Soup - for parsing HTML
     * Click - a nice way of doing CLI interfaces
     * Django - A full fledged high performance Web framework
     * Numpy & SciPy - Dealing with numeric and scientific data
     * Panda3d - 3d Interface and objects
     * Mathplotlib - graphic mathematical data

   and the list goes on and on and on.

   It takes a few weeks to learn the Python Language - and year to learn what it can do for you :-)

***
   Well that depends on your intentions after learning that language.
   Do you want to make some great GUI applications with it ? Than just go on and have a look at Tkinter
   , Wxpython and many more python libraries that give great support for Gui scripts. Which may be easy
   to convert in an application using pyexe (for windows .exe) , pyinstaller (mac and linux) or cxfreez
   (cross platform).
   Python has many awesome libraries that can make your computer dance at your finger tips. Want to make
   simple web scripts ? Look into urllib and webbrowser modules (u can just import webbrowser and start
   any web page with python script when ever you want in just 1 line of code !!)
   An Facebook / twitter addict? make a python script to auto post / tweet as you desire. And what you
   have to do for it you ask? Just import Facebook/Twitter and 2 lines of code.....Damn simple.
   Want to develop a good web site with superb MVC backend but hate PhP (or don't have any experience of
   it...) ? Just look into Django - python. A great framework that is easy to learn and that can make
   your website up and running in less than 15 mins with admin interface. No need to have knowledge of
   any database (Mysql / Mongodb / sqllite3) ...Django handles it itself after you just tell it that
   what database you use.
   There are some fantastic libraries that enables integration of python with matlab and other such
   awesome softwares. That is why python is language of scientists , economist , engineers AND newbees
   as well. You can do nearly anything with it and if you are stuck you have a great community to help
   you out and point you at right direction.
   If you are into competitive programming than it is one of the most used programming language in this
   field. Go on any coding web site and flex your logic muscles with this new acquired powers that
   python have blessed you with and you will be unstoppable ( With practice of course  !!)
   So good luck for your future journey in world of python and Happy coding ..!

   Play.

   If you have no ideas, I'll give a few here:
     * Guess my number - user has to guess a random number between 1–20. They only have 7 guesses.
     * Guess my Animal - user has to guess a random animal. They get 3 clues.
     * Maze game. Complicated, but possible in the console.
     * Snake. Again, possible in the console.
     * Space Invaders - might wanna use tkinter for that.
