Count the number of occurrences of each character and return it as a list of tuples in order of appearance
April 15, 2019

   In this example we are going to create a function which will count the number of occurrences of each
   character and return it as a list of tuples in order of appearance. For example,
ordered_count("abracadabra") == [('a', 5), ('b', 2), ('r', 2), ('c', 1), ('d', 1)]

   The above is a 7 kyu question on CodeWars, this is the only question I can solve today after the
   first two fail attempts.

   I am supposed to start the Blender project today but because I want to write a post for your people I
   have spent nearly an hour and a half working on those three python questions on CodeWars, I hope you
   people will really appreciate my effort and will share this post to help this website to grown.
def ordered_count(input):

    already = []
    input_list = list(input)
    return_list = []
    for word in input_list:
        if(word not in already):
            return_list.append((word, input_list.count(word)))
            already.append(word)

    return return_list

   The solution above is short and solid, hope you like it.
