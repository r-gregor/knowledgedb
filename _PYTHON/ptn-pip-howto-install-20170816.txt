How To Install PIP to Manage Python Packages in Linux

   Pip (recursive acronym for “Pip Installs Packages” or “Pip Installs Python“) is a cross-platform
   package manager for installing and managing Python packages (which can be found in the Python Package
   Index (PyPI)) that comes with Python 2 >=2.7.9 or Python 3 >=3.4 binaries that are downloaded from
   python.org.

Install PIP in Linux Systems

   To install pip in Linux, run the appropriate command for your distribution as follows:

Install PIP On Debian/Ubuntu

# apt install python-pip        #python 2
# apt install python3-pip       #python 3

Install PIP On CentOS and RHEL

   Unluckily, pip is not packaged in official software repositories of CentOS/RHEL. So you need to
   enable the EPEL repository and then install it like this.
# yum install epel-release
# yum install python-pip

Install PIP on Fedora

# dnf install python-pip        #Python 2
# dnf install python3           #Python 3

Install PIP on Arch Linux

# pacman -S python2-pip         #Python 2
# pacman -S python-pip          #Python 3

Install PIP on openSUSE

# zypper install python-pip     #Python 2
# zypper install python3-pip    #Python 3
