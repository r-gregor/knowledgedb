10 Python Examples That Will Make You a Better Programmer
March 27, 2023

   Python is a versatile and powerful programming language, known for its readability and ease of use.
   As a programmer, learning new coding techniques and best practices is essential for growth and skill
   development. In this article, we will explore 10 Python examples that will help you improve your
   programming abilities and make you a better programmer.

1. List Comprehensions
   List comprehensions provide a concise way to create lists in Python. They are an elegant and
   efficient way to transform one list into another by applying an expression to each element.

   Example: Calculate the square of numbers from 0 to 9

   squares = [x**2 for x in range(10)]
   print(squares)

   Output
   [0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81]

2. Dictionary Comprehensions
   Similar to list comprehensions, dictionary comprehensions allow you to create dictionaries with a
   single line of code. This technique makes your code more concise and readable.

   Example: Create a dictionary where the keys are numbers from 0 to 9 and the values are their squares

   squared_dict = {x: x**2 for x in range(10)}
   print(squared_dict)

   Output
   {0: 0, 1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9, 4: 16, 5: 25, 6: 36, 7: 49, 8: 64, 9: 81}

3. Lambda Functions
   Lambda functions are small, anonymous functions that can be defined in a single line of code. They
   are useful when you need a simple function for a short period.

   Example: Sort a list of numbers based on the remainder when divided by 2

   numbers = [3, 1, 4, 2, 5]
   sorted_list = sorted(numbers, key=lambda x: x % 2)
   print(sorted_list)

   Output
   [4, 2, 3, 1, 5]

4. Using the Zip Function
   The zip function can be used to combine two or more iterables, creating a new iterable with pairs of
   elements from the original iterables. This is useful when you need to work with corresponding
   elements from multiple lists.

   Example: Combine two lists into a dictionary

   names = ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"]
   ages = [25, 30, 35]
   combined = dict(zip(names, ages))
   print(combined)


   Output
   {'Alice': 25, 'Bob': 30, 'Charlie': 35}

5. Error Handling with Try-Except
   The try-except block allows you to catch exceptions and handle them gracefully, preventing your
   program from crashing due to unhandled errors.

   Example: Handle division by zero

   try:
	   result = 10 / 0
   except ZeroDivisionError:
	   result = "undefined"

   print(result)

   Output
   undefined

6. Using Enumerate
   The enumerate function is useful for iterating over a list when you need both the index and the value
   of each element. This makes your code more readable and efficient.

   Example: Print the index and value of each element in a list

   names = ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"]
   for index, value in enumerate(names):
	   print(f"{index}: {value}")

   Output
   0: Alice 1: Bob 2: Charlie

7. Using Generators
   Generators allow you to create iterators that yield values one at a time, saving memory compared to
   storing the entire dataset in a list.

   Example: Generate Fibonacci numbers up to a limit

	def fibonacci(limit):
		a, b = 0, 1
		while a < limit:
			yield a
			a, b = b, a + b

	for num in fibonacci(50):
		print(num)

   Output
   0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34

8. Using Decorators
   Decorators are a powerful feature in Python that allows you to extend or modify the behavior of
   functions or methods. They can be used for logging, memoization, or access control, among other
   things.

   Example: Measure the execution time of a function

	import time

	def time_it(func):
		def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
			start = time.time()
			result = func(*args, **kwargs)
			print(f"{func.__name__} took {time.time() - start}s")
			return result
		return wrapper

	@time_it
	def slow_function():
		time.sleep(2)

	slow_function()

   Output
   slow_function took 2.0001118183135986s

9. Context Managers
   Context managers simplify the management of resources, such as files or network connections, by
   automatically handling their acquisition and release. They can be created using the with statement.

   Context managers simplify the management of resources, such as files or network connections, by
   automatically handling their acquisition and release. They can be created using the with statement.

   Example: Read the content of a file

	with open("file.txt", "r") as file:
		content = file.read()
	print(content)

   Assuming "file.txt" contains the following text:
   Hello, World!

   Then the output will be like:

   Output
   Hello, World!

10. Using the Collections Module
   The collections module provides specialized container datatypes that can make your code more
   efficient and readable. Some of the most commonly used collections are namedtuple, deque, Counter,
   and defaultdict.

   Example: Use namedtuple, deque, Counter, and defaultdict

	from collections import namedtuple, deque, Counter, defaultdict
	# namedtuple
	Person = namedtuple('Person', ['name', 'age'])
	person = Person("Alice", 25)
	print(person.name, person.age)
	# deque
	queue = deque([1, 2, 3])
	queue.append(4)
	print(queue.popleft())
	# Counter
	words = ["apple", "banana", "apple", "orange", "banana", "apple"]
	word_count = Counter(words)
	print(word_count)
	# defaultdict
	grades = [('Alice', 95), ('Bob', 85), ('Alice', 92), ('Bob', 99)]
	grade_dict = defaultdict(list)
	for name, grade in grades:
		grade_dict[name].append(grade)
	print(grade_dict)

Alice 25
1
Counter({'apple': 3, 'banana': 2, 'orange': 1})
defaultdict(, {'Alice': [95, 92], 'Bob': [85, 99]})
