   Howdoi can be easily installed using pip utility. To install pip in your Linux distribution, do the
   following steps.

   On Debian, Ubuntu, Linux Mint:
	sudo apt-get install python-pip

   Once PIP installed, run the following command to install ‘Howdoi’.
	sudo pip install howdoi

‘Howdoi’ Usage

   The typical syntax of Howdoi is:
howdoi [-h] [-p POS] [-a] [-l] [-c] [-n NUM_ANSWERS] [-C] [-v] QUERY [QUERY ...]

   Here,
     * -h – Displays the help section
     * -p POS – Select answer in specified position (default: 1)
     * -a – Displays the full text of the answer
     * -l  – Displays only the answer link
     * -c – Enables colorized output
     * -n NUM_ANSWERS – Number of answers to return
     * -C – Clears the cache
     * -v – Displays the current version of howdoi

   Let us see some examples. For example, to know how to use print function in python or java, use
   following commands:
	howdoi print python

   Sample output:
	print("Total score for %s is %s " % (name, score))
	howdoi print java

   Output:
	System.out.print("\"Hello\"");

   To know how to create an archive, just run the following command:
	howdoi create tar archive

   Sample output would be:
	tar czf file.tar.gz file.txt

   You could use this command to create a tar archive of file.txt. Similarly, you can search any
   commands. Here is how to know the command format to create a file or directory.
	howdoi create file touch

   Sample output:
	touch ../my_directory/file

   Similarly, you can view how to create a directory as shown below.

   Sample output:
	mkdir -p foo


   To know how to format a date in bash, just run:
	howdoi format date bash

   Sample output:
	DATE=`date +%Y-%m-%d`

   Please note that this utility may not find answers to all queries, but it will help you to find
   answers to some basic codes and command queries.
