How do I copy an object in Python?

   Try opy.copy or opy.deepcopy for the general case. Not all objects can be copied, but most can.
import copy

newobj = copy.copy(oldobj) # shallow copy
newobj = copy.deepcopy(oldobj) # deep (recursive) copy

   Some objects can be copied more easily. Dictionaries have a [4]copy method:
newdict = olddict.copy()

   Sequences can be copied by slicing:
new_list = L[:]

   You can also use the list, tuple, dict, and set functions to copy the corresponding
   objects, and to convert between different sequence types:
new_list = list(L) # copy
new_dict = dict(olddict) # copy

new_set = set(L) # convert list to set
new_tuple = tuple(L) # convert list to tuple
