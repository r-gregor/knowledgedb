   What can Python do?

***
   Pardon the LOTR reference, but for me python is "One ring to rule them all"
   I use python for almost any type of project. For example.
   1. Python is very powerful when paired with Django for rapid web development.
   2. I used python for a web crawling project for the sheer ease and number of libraries it provides
   for trivial tasks such as parsing a web page. Earlier I used Java and I had to write almost every
   trivial module.
   3. NumPy/Scikit Libraries are one of the best available tools for scientific computing. Mathematica
   is more powerful, but integrating it with a real world project not a feasible job.
   4. The Scapy and Socket libraries in python are great tools for all your networking related needs.
   Move over nMap and Metasploit.
   As [13]Rishabh Roy mentioned, Python is seductive, and after using Python (and Ruby) I shudder at the
   thought of using Java/C/C++ for any project despite it's flaws.

   Hi, Python can do many things.

   Such as:
     * Backend development（Django / Flask / Tornado）
     * Scientific Computing（Numpy / Scipy / Matplotlib）
     * Machine learning（Scikit-Learn）
     * Neural Networks（TensorFlow）
     * Operation and maintenance（supervisor / fabric）
     * Image processing（Pillow）
     * Web Crawler（Requests / Xpath / Scrapy）

   With the development of the Internet, Python will be use more and more fields.

   And here’re some awesome website to learn Python:

   Among other things, Python is also used for creating chatbots.

   Python is used mostly for it’s simplicity. It has a straightforward syntax and it’s object-oriented.
   It is also one of the most widely used programming languages in the field of Artificial Intelligence,
   again, thanks to it’s simplicity. AIl chatbots are easy to write in Python with the use of
   AIML — Artificial Intelligence Markup Language. AIML is actually a form of XML for creating natural
   language software agents.

   a Slack chatbot using Python.
