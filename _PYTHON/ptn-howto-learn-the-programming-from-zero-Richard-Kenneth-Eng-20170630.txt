How can I learn the programming from zero?

   I always recommend that beginners start with Smalltalk. Smalltalk was the first language to
   popularize object-oriented programming (or OOP), and it remains the finest OOP language in existence.

   OOP is the most widely used style of programming in the world.

   Smalltalk served as the archetype for nearly all OOP languages in use today…Java, Python, C#, PHP,
   Ruby, Perl, Objective-C, CLOS, Groovy, Scala, Dart, etc. These languages owe a lot to Smalltalk.

   So if you want to truly understand OOP, then it would be irresponsible not to study Smalltalk.

   Once you’ve learned how to program with Smalltalk, picking up a second language like Python or Java
   would be a breeze. So learn Smalltalk first.

   To learn Smalltalk: Start with a good tutorial. Then start writing some simple programs to reinforce
   your understanding of the language’s syntax and features.

   Here are some great resources:
     * a nice, gentle tutorial — [http://amber-lang.net/learn.html]Learn Smalltalk with Prof Stef
     * the most actively developed Smalltalk — [http://pharo.org/]Welcome to Pharo!
     * a free book — [http://files.pharo.org/books/updated-pharo-by-example/]Updated Pharo by Example
     * a MOOC (massive open online course) — [ttp://files.pharo.org/mooc/]Live Object Programming in Pharo
     * some great videos — [http://www.jarober.com/blog/st4u.ssp]Smalltalk 4 You
     * a book that I like (not based on Pharo) — [http://sdmeta.gforge.inria.fr/FreeBooks/ByExample/]
                                                  Smalltalk by Example
     * another book that I like (not based on Pharo) — 
       [http://stephane.ducasse.free.fr/FreeBooks/Gnu/ProgrammingUsingGnuSmalltalk.pdf]
        Computer Programming using GNU Smalltalk
     * some additional resources — [https://smalltalkrenaissance.wordpress.com/resources/]Resources

   This book (not free) is my favourite for learning how to use Smalltalk for object-oriented
   programming: [https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1583484906/claritycomputing]
                 Smalltalk, Objects, and Design, by Chamond Liu.

   I myself have published a whole bunch of Smalltalk tutorials. The latest ones are:
     * [https://medium.com/learn-how-to-program/latest]Learn How To Program
     * [https://medium.com/p/precious-zinc-teapot-on-the-web-9e36a21c5576]Precious Zinc Teapot on the Web

   Good luck.
