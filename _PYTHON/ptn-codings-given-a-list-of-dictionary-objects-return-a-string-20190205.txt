Given a list of dictionary objects, return a string
January 29, 2019

   Good morning again and today we are going to solve one of the fundamental problems on Codewars.

   The question goes like this, given a list of dictionary objects consist of the name of a person, we
   need to return a string which contains all those names of a person in those dictionaries within that
   list. The program will need to separate each person name with a comma, if there are only two persons
   in the list or the program has reached the last two persons on the list then the program will
   separate the name with an ‘&’ instead. If there is only one person on the given list then the program
   will just return the name of that person or if there is nobody on the list then the program will just
   return an empty string. Below is the program.

<code>
# filename: test.py

def namelist(names):

    str = ''

    if(len(names) == 0): # if no dictionary within the list
        return ''

    elif(len(names) == 1): # if only one dictionary within the list
        return names[0]['name']

    for i in range(len(names)):
        if(i == len(names)-2): # if reaches the second last dictionary
            str += names[i]['name'] + ' &amp; '
        elif(i == len(names) - 1): # if reaches the last dictionary
            str += names[i]['name']
        else:
            str += names[i]['name'] + ', '

    return str

   # After a few runs, we get the below outcomes.
print(namelist([{'name' : 'Johnny'}, {'name' : 'Bill'}, {'name' : 'Mickey'}]))
print(namelist([{'name' : 'Johnny'}, {'name' : 'Bill'}]))
print(namelist([{'name' : 'Johnny'}]))
print(namelist([]))
</code>

OUTPUT:
$> gregor.redelonghi@cygwin-en [/home/gregor.redelonghi/BRISI]
$> python3 ./test.py
Johnny, Bill &amp; Mickey
Johnny &amp; Bill
Johnny

   That is it, I will visit the above-mentioned website or other sites that are similar to that one
   every day to solve one or two problems to help my brain stays active!
