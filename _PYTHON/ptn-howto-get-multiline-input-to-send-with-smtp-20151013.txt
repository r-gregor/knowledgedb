OK, I've been to python.org, I've gone through Guido's tutorial, I've looked
at a few modules.

I've even been able to sort of send mails through a SMTP server and retrieve
articles off of an NNTP server. So I have *some* clue.

But apparently not enough.

How can I get an interactive Python session to read in something like this:

------------------------------
Hello.
How are you?
I'm fine.
Thanks for asking.
------------------------------

So that the newline characters are preserved, and when I print them out, they
are printed to the screen?

When I retrieved the news articles off the NNTP server, for instance, the
message body was just one big long string, with some numeric code for the
newlines. It was just a mess to read.

Replying to my own post:

OK, it seems simple enough to accomplish this in the IDLE environment or at a
command line prompt:

>>> print '''Hello.
... How are you?
... Fine.
... Thanks for asking.'''
Hello.
How are you?
Fine.
Thanks for asking.
>>>


Just use triple quotes.

But, how do I accomplish something like this (here is a small SMTP script I
wrote for investigation):

import smtplib, string

servername=input("SMTP server name: ")
Fromaddress=input("From address: ")
Toaddress=input("To address: ")
MessageText=input("message text: ")
server=smtplib.SMTP(servername)
server.sendmail(Fromaddress, Toaddress, MessageText)
server.quit()

The above script will not allow MessageText to have multiple lines.

You may want to use raw_input() instead of input(): input() acts like the
interpreter, so with it, you'll need to quote your strings.  I'm quite
sure that can get a bit annoying.  raw_input(), on the other hand, always
assumes that you want to get strings, so it doesn't require quotes.


To read multiple lines of text... hmmm... there are several ways to do
this.  How should the program know when to stop reading lines?  input()
and raw_input() are set up only to work on single lines, so you could
write a specialty inputting function instead that stops when it sees a
certain "terminating" line.

###
def readManyLines():
    """Read lines from the user until they enter a line with a single
period, and return a single string."""
    result = ""
    while 1:
        line = raw_input()
        if line == '.': return result
        result = result + line
###

Here's an example run:

###
>>> msg = readManyLines()
This is a test
of the emergency
broadcast system.
.
>>> msg   
'This is a testof the emergencybroadcast system.'
>>> print msg
This is a testof the emergencybroadcast system.
###

Hmmm... that's a bug!  I needed to add newlines between the
concatentations.  I think you should be able to fix this ok.

Hope this helps!

Yes, thanks very much. It helped a great deal. Here is my final code:

-----------------------------------------------------------
import smtplib

def readManyLines():
    """Read lines from the user until they enter a line with a single
period, and return a single string."""
    result = ""
    while 1:
        line = raw_input()
        if line == '.': return result
        result = result + line + "\n"

servername=raw_input("SMTP server name: ")
Fromaddress=raw_input("From address: ")
Toaddress=raw_input("To address: ")
print "Enter your message. To end, enter a line that begins with a"
print "period and has no other characters: "
MessageText=readManyLines()
server=smtplib.SMTP(servername)
server.sendmail(Fromaddress, Toaddress, MessageText)
server.quit()
--------------------------------------------------------------

I was able to run that on a DOS prompt, and send out e-mails with it. Great.
Now I'm getting ready to start working with input from files. My goal is to
write some mail filtering scripts to use on my web hosting site, to
automatically forward certain e-mails to Spamcop.net. (When I get this figured
out, I'm planning to get an account with them.)

I have other projects up my sleeve, too. But that's the first one.
