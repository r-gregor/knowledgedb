    You cannot assign to a list like lst[i] = something, unless the list already is initialized
    with at least i+1 elements. You need to use append to add elements to the end of the list:
    lst.append(something) --> it appends an elemnt to the end of the list.
    
            # Creating an empty list:
            >>> l = [None] * 10
            >>> l
            [None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None]

            # Assigning a value to an existing element of the above list:
            >>> l[1] = 5
            >>> l
            [None, 5, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None]
