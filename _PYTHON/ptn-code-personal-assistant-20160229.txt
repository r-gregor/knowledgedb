How To Code Your Own Personal Assistant Using Python Programming
   
   personal assistant jarvis Short Bytes: In this article, I’m sharing the efforts of a programmer to
   create his own python-powered personal assistant. Using open source libraries for text-to-speech
   conversion and speech recognition, he describes a way to create a personal “Jarvis”.

   As his 2016’s challenge, Facebook co-founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced that he’ll be coding
   his own AI personal assistant. While I don’t know about the progress made by him in this endeavour,
   there are many existing resources that you can use to create something similar for yourself.

   Python is one of the most popular programming languages that people should consider learning ([28]get
   started here) and it comes with several choices to get started on your own Jarvis project. There are
   many open libraries for speech recognition and synthesis available in Python. Note that you should
   choose them wisely as many of them don’t function anymore with newer versions of Python.

   In a blog post, programmer [29]Gurwinder Gulati shared his quest to make a Python-powered personal
   assistant for himself in 2016. He calls his AI assistant Samwise and explains the coding process in
   three parts: Jarvis’s Mouth, Jarvis’s Ears, and Jarvis’s Brain.

   As the name suggests, Jarvis’s Mouth deals with text-to-speech conversion process. While many Python
   libraries are available that offer voice recognition and speech synthesis, Mr. Gulati chose to move
   ahead with pyttsx — an offline, free and open source resource. It’s also updated to work with Python
   3. To use it, you need to install JPercent’s version of [30]pyttsx by running the command pip install
   pyttsx. For Windows, you should install [31]PyWin32 and Microsoft Speech API.

   For speech recognition/Jarvis’s ears, you need to use [32]SpeechRecognition. This great resource
   offers the freedom to use Sphinx project to convert the audio input into a text. You can also use
   Google services and Wit.ai to do the same with the help of SpeechRecognition.

   Now that you’ve got everything you need, let’s take a look at Jarvis’s Brain which is basically the
   code written by Mr. Gulati. You can assemble the above-mentioned resources and libraries to create
   your own AI assistant.

   The code shared below is pretty straightforward and you can get things done after few hours of work
   and research. Take a look:

<code>
import speech_recognition
import pyttsx

speech_engine = pyttsx.init('sapi5') # see http://pyttsx.readthedocs.org/en/latest/engine.html#pyttsx.init
speech_engine.setProperty('rate', 150)

def speak(text):
	speech_engine.say(text)
	speech_engine.runAndWait()

recognizer = speech_recognition.Recognizer()

def listen():
	with speech_recognition.Microphone() as source:
		recognizer.adjust_for_ambient_noise(source)
		audio = recognizer.listen(source)

	try:
		return recognizer.recognize_sphinx(audio)
		# or: return recognizer.recognize_google(audio)
	except speech_recognition.UnknownValueError:
		print("Could not understand audio")
	except speech_recognition.RequestError as e:
		print("Recog Error; {0}".format(e))

	return ""

speak("Say something!")
speak("I heard you say " + listen()) 
</code>
