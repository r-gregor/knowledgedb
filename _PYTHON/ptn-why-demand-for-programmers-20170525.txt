   Why is there such a demand for Python programmers?

   Python is great for teaching & scripting, and there’s Zope - but for production deployment or
   commercial products: PHP owns the web; Java owns web services, commercial systems & Android,
   Objective-C & Swift dominate iOS, .Net dominates desktops - who’s hiring python coders, and to do
   what?

   Python is almost irreplaceable when it comes to Artificial Intelligence!

   And it is the era of the AI.

   Machine learning relies on well-written and well-optimized languages that do the heavy lifting.
   Nobody wants to write convolutions from scratch in C so most of the engineers prefer to start with it
   just because of its libraries.

   Python creates high-level abstractions that allow you to treat everything like an object and not to
   worry about memory management and the peculiarities of CUDA programming.

   It is true that [13]Django (web framework) boosted it a lot in the past few years, but [14]Artificial
   Intelligence is what is driving its popularity and developers demand lately.

   One major factor is [25]Django.

   I’ve been employed full-time working on Django-based sites since 2010. Big ones — a publishing
   platform doing millions of pageviews a day, an ecommerce API billing millions of dollars a year, an
   enterprise app with thousands of users. The skills are in demand.

   So your belief about what stacks “own the web” or “own web services” needs to be expanded to include
   this reality.

   Re Zope, frankly it’s curious that you mention it at all. There are many other Python web frameworks
   (e.g. Flask, Pyramid) that are more heavily used than Zope these days.

   It's easy language to pick up. It's well thought language on the universities around the world.

   But Python has got a lot of places where you can apply it.

   In our case it's the main “glue language”.

   We write a lot of C++, but almost all of our system tests are written with shellscript and Python.

   We also use it for quick prototyping of the possible solutions that we might use in the future.

   It has got a ton of libraries, and is one of the languages that's fairly easy to write the extension
   for.

   And as others mentioned - being able to use a single language in statistics, bioinformatics and web
   is a big win for the language itself.

   Python has become the language of choice for numerous applications that span across the entire
   technology industry. Here is a curated list of python libraries used in different domains.
     * Django - [34]The Web framework for perfectionists with deadlines - To create amazing websites
       with readable code. See this for inspiration - [35]25 of the Most Popular Python and Django
       Websites
     * Flask - [36]Flask (A Python Microframework) - Minimal framework for website development using
       Python. Easy to get started with tons of online tutorials.
     * scikit-learn - [37]scikit-learn: machine learning in Python - Every algorithm in Machine Learning
       is implemented in this library which can be used across multiple domains such as Computer Vision,
       Natural Language Processing, Music Information Retrieval etc.
     * Keras - [38]Keras Documentation - Made it easier to do Deep Learning just with your laptop
       (without GPU).
     * TensorFlow - [39]TensorFlow - Google’s open-source library for Machine Intelligence which is at
       the top in GitHub.
     * OpenCV - [40]OpenCV-Python Tutorials - Every company now shifted to Self-driving cars, Autonomous
       drones all with the advancements in Computer Vision. Numerous algorithms are implemented in
       OpenCV library such as SIFT, SURF, ORB etc.
     * Pexpect - [41]Pexpect version 4.2 - In network automation, one can use this library to automate
       many manual tasks.
     * NLTK - [42]Natural Language Toolkit - Home for NLTK developers that is used for Natural Language
       processing stuff such as Text Classification, Topic Classification, Speech to Text etc.,
     * NumPy - [43]NumPy - NumPy - Linear Algebra became extremely easier with NumPy. This library gives
       the power to work with matrices and tables without any burden.
     * matplotlib - [44]Python plotting - Matplotlib 2.0.2 documentation, Seaborn - [45]Seaborn:
       statistical data visualization, Plotly - [46]Visualize Data, Together - Data Visualization
       libraries to better understand data. Extremely useful for Data Analysts and Data Scientists.
     * Pandas - [47]Python Data Analysis Library - To work with Excel sheets and database. It gives the
       ability to perform Data Manipulation with ease using Python.
     * Librosa - [48]Librosa - Used to play with Audio data. Very popular Music analysis library for
       Python.
     * Pygame - [49]Pygame - Library to work with video games.

   And the list goes on!!!!

   I’m not sure where you’re getting the market data from… but python is quite capable of running
   production web applications and web services. Quora, for example, is written using Pyramid framework,
   which is in python. In terms of new developments (startups, new apps, etc), my feeling is that Python
   is more popular than PHP unless you’re using wordpress or are particularly good with PHP frameworks
   like Symphony or Laravel.

   In the web services space, Python is also a strong contender. There are a lot of packages out there
   for building web services in python, and the reasons to prefer Python over Java applies to choosing a
   language for web services as well.

   .NET does not dominate desktops. Sure, it is the lingua franca of GUI development in Windows, but in
   Linux/Mac, not so much. I will say however that Python is not a strong contender for desktop app
   development. Desktop apps are usually written in C#, Java, C++, or if you’re hip, Javascript with
   Electron.

   A big source of demand for python development outside of web backends is data science and data
   engineering. The python ecosystem for analyzing and managing data is very well developed and popular.
