Encrypt the text with python
January 7, 2019

   Hello again, today let us continue to explore the question on the previous website which allows us to
   develop a game with python. In this chapter, we are going to create a function which will encrypt the
   text passes in as the first argument based on the integer passed in as the second argument to that
   same function. This function will only accept the lowercase character from a-z and the empty space.
   What this function does is to add up the character code of an a-z character with the second argument
   of that function to produce a new character and finally return the entire new text based upon this
   encrypt method.
   
from string import punctuation

def to_encrypt(text, delta):

    to_list = list(text)
    new_text = ''

    for item in to_list:

        if(item not in punctuation):
            if(item.isspace()):
                new_text += ' '
            else:
                if(delta > 0):
                    new = (ord(item) + delta + 26)
                    if(new > 122):
                        new = new - 122 + 96
                    new_text += chr(new)
                else:
                    new = (ord(item) + delta)

                    if(new > 122):
                        new = new - 122 + 96
                    new_text += chr(new)

    return new_text

   The above method will take care of the overflow issue where if the character code has get passed the
   a-z character code range after the summation process then the difference between the maximum/minimum
   value of character code and the overflow value will be used to recalculate the new character
   position. The empty space in the text will be left alone.

   I do wish you like this one, we will continue to solve more problems together on this site and the
   other site as well in the coming article.
