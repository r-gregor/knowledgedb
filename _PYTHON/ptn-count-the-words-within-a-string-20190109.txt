Count the words within a string with python
January 6, 2019

   Hello and nice to meet you all again. In this article, we will continue to solve the problem on the
     - py.checkio.org website. This website has provided a great opportunity for those python
   programmers that want to see how good their python skills really are by allowing them to solve
   various programming problems with python. Just like what I had mentioned before, I am still in the
   stage of finding it out what else does this site has to offer besides asking us to solve python
   related questions but before I can go even further I need to solve some basic problems first. In this
   article, we will solve the below problem with python.

   Given a string as the first parameter and a set of lowercase words as the second parameter of a
   function, find out how many words in that set have appeared in the given string. The program will
   need to convert the string to the lowercase letterâ€™s string first because this is not a
   case-sensitive comparison.
def count_words(text: str, words: set):
    word_list = list(words)
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(word_list)):

        if(word_list[i] in text.lower()):
            print(word_list[i])
            count+=1
    return count

print(count_words("Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit.",
                       {"sum", "hamlet", "infinity", "anything"}))

   The above program will output these values with above inputs: sum, 1, as you can see that program
   will search for those words in the set in each word and partial word of the given string.
