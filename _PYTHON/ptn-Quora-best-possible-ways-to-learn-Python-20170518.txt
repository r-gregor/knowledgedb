   What are the best possible ways to learn Python?

***
   Programming’s like riding a bike. Once you learn it you can never forget it.

   This is true for a gifted few. I’m not one of them.

   I “learned” once Python before. Then I started over and really learned Python.

   Both times, I took [15]Introduction to Computer Science from MIT and read books (Think Python and
   Learn Python the Hard Way are two that come to mind).
    [15. https://opencourser.com/course/edx-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-using-python]
   
   In my first go around, I learned passively. I watched the lecture videos, did the exercises, and took
   my quizzes and exams. I felt good about getting an 80+% for my final grade, patted myself on the
   shoulders, and called it a day.

   Then I let my Python/programming “muscles” atrophy, not realizing they were atrophying until weeks
   after the the final exam.

   I distinctly remember the first time I tried writing Python on my own after the course had finished.
   There was a long list of phone numbers I needed to process, many of them in different formats.

   The list might have looked something like this:
'(212)555-5555'
'1-212-555-5556'
'2125555557'

   And I needed it to turn into this:
'212-555-5555'
'212-555-5556'
'212-555-5557'

   I thought, cool! I could do this. Easy peasy. No problem.

   I was woefully mistaken.

   Putting together a solution was a struggle. I mean, I couldn’t even get the file to open properly,
   let alone parse through it. Eventually I figured it out. Well, someone else did anyway. A good chunk
   of my solution came from cobbling code others had written in StackOverflow.

   Worse than realizing that I didn’t really know Python anymore was coming to terms with the fact that
   I had dumped almost 100 hours into half-learning it.

   Learning about the best ways to learn Python the hard way

   Eventually, I decided I wanted to learn Python properly. In my mind, Python was a tool that could
   help me become more productive and efficient in my work. It might even help me build tools on top of
   it. So I retook the course.

   My second time learning Python proved successful. So afraid I was of repeating my previous failure
   that I did all I could to reinforce my learning.

   Based on my experiences, the best way to learn Python then is to reinforce frequently and thoroughly.
   Here’s how:
     * Solve programming challenges

     * Use these to solidify core concepts you learn until writing Python and solving problems in it
       become second nature

     * Bookmark [16]Project Euler. It’s filled with interesting math problems that are solveable using
       Python. Note: You don’t need to be a math whiz to solve most problems on this site.
     * Also check out [17]The Riddler from the FiveThirtyEight blog. Some of its brain teasers are fun.
       Others are near sadistic. Many can be solved computationally with Python.
       [16. https://projecteuler.net/]
       [17. https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/the-riddler/]

     Recreate the wheel
     * It’s not everyday you’ll hear someone tell you to recreate the wheel, but here it helps you think
       about how you might apply Python in practical ways. It’s also encouraging to see your Python code
       do something useful. Example projects:

     * Building a timer (don’t use for mission-critical applications like roasting a turkey unless
       you’ve tested your app thoroughly)
     * Make a weather app with the help of a weather API (like [18]OpenWeatherMap)
       [18. https://openweathermap.org/api]
       
     * Make a calculator. As a challenge, make a graphing calculator.

     Help others learn Python
     * One of the best ways to reinforce concepts you’ve learned is by teaching it to someone else. Some
       ways you can do this:

     * If you’re taking an online course, participate in discussion forums and help classmates out with
       questions they have
     * Also consider answering questions in communities on StackOverflow or Reddit ([19]/r/learnpython,
       for example)
       [19. https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/]

     Do the above at least once or twice each week

     Do the above even after hitting your learning milestones (like finishing an online course)

   Think of Python as your adorable pet snake.

   When you first get it, it’s unfamiliar with you as you are with it. You have to feed it, care for it,
   and nurture it so that it trusts you. If it trusts you, it’ll more likely come to you when you call
   its name. Maybe it’ll even stick around forever.

   Neglect it, however, and it’ll slither away in search of a more caring owner. Try not to let that
   happen.

   Disclosure: I’ve never owned a pet snake.

   Python, like any other programming language can be learnt only by practicing and writing small
   programs/projects.
   I realize this is a very common answer and an irritating one too, but it's probably the only way,
   unless ofcourse you are a true genius! :P
   That said, I'm not going to leave you hanging. There are tons of resources to start learning and
   practicing python (or any other language really).
   1. YouTube.
        If your the kind of person who learns watching people do stuff, this is the place to go. Tons of
   tutorial videos are available that teach you the basics of python programming
   2. Online courses
        Fundamentally similar to YouTube videos, but more structured and usually project oriented. You
   basically work on a project as you learn the language. A good one is the python class on Udacity.
   3. Books
       Probably my favourite! Pick up a tutorial book and go through it. Don't be lazy though. Try
   programming code snippets. It helps.
   4. Other people
        If you know some one who is a programmer, need not be a professional, they may be of great
   assistance. Even if they don't work in python they can help you out with how you formuate logic, how
   you can string up different lines of code to make something awesome and so on! They are also a great
   place to go when your stuck. Don't bother them too much though :P
   5. Lastly - Google (Bing if you're that sort of a person)
        Yes. Any problem you encounter can be searched for online. You will always find some good answer
   that will help you out.
   Stackoverflow is one such site.
   Finally, once you feel like you have a reasonable understanding of the basics ( variables,
   conditions, loops, functions...) You should try our online competition sites like codechef,
   hackerrank , topcoder, etc..
   It is a great way to solidify your understanding of stuff you learnt.

   Original question cited “no programming experience.” If you've got experience with other languages,
   learning Python isn't too hard. Check out Udemy, or just get a book and get coding.

   You might be able to learn some trivial things in Python and build some simple projects, but you
   won't be in any shape to do it professionally after one month. This stuff takes years.

   Some very smart people can learn it in a few months and apply it well, but they're an exception. Most
   need a year at least.

   If you want to be any good, the first step is learning about data structures and things like search
   and sort algorithms. You can learn these via Python, or any other language. Then you code, and code
   some more.

   Getting a job as a developer is an even bigger challenge if you don't have a CS degree or prior
   experience (which you said you don't have).

   Python is a tool, not the art.

***
   Original question: “Is it possible to learn Python in a month if you have absolutely no coding
   experience? What would be the best way to go about learning Python?”

   I'll ask what is the goal? If you want to do this as learning experience or expand your horizon then
   by all means. If you are planning to land a job then probability is very low. For later first ensure
   if this is what you want and do you have right inclination like problem solving, etc.

   From learning perspective there are bunch of free online courses on Coursera or other websites which
   can make it easy and fun.

   Good Luck!
