   What is the best book for self-taught machine learning in Python for beginners?

***
   Definitely Python Machine Learning by Sebastian Raschka.

   If you have a week for learning some of the most important machine learning methods (tree based
   ensemble, penalised linear regression, etc) I would suggest Machine Learning in Python: Essential
   Techniques for Predictive Analysis by Michael Bowles.
