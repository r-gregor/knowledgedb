How do I calculate number of months between two dates ?

   I have the need to find the number of months between two dates in python. Is there any standard
   python method to do that ?

***
   Can yo be more specific? How many months should be between april 30 and may 1st of the same year? And
   what about 1-st and last day of a specific month. And what about 15 of month x and 14 of month x+1?

***
   You can try this:
from datetime import datetime
from dateutil import relativedelta
date1 = datetime.strptime(str('2011-08-15 12:00:00'), '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')
date2 = datetime.strptime(str('2012-02-15'), '%Y-%m-%d')
r = relativedelta.relativedelta(date2, date1)
r.months

   This will give you number of months between two dates.

***
   for example:
from datetime import datetime
def days_between(d1, d2):
    d1 = datetime.strptime(d1, "%Y-%m-%d")
    d2 = datetime.strptime(d2, "%Y-%m-%d")
    return abs((d2 - d1).days)

print days_between('2013-05-06', '2013-06-06')

***
   If you want the number of months you should use dateutil.relativedelta, as in Priyesh's answer. The
   reason for that is because it hides all the complex calculations required for different lengths of
   months, leap years, etc.
