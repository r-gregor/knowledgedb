Translate normal character to NATO phonetic alphabet with python
January 28, 2019

   Hello and welcome back, today we will create a NATO code translator program with python which will
   translate each character in any normal text into a NATO phonetic alphabet. This program will ignore
   the space within words and will not change the punctuation characters within that normal text.

   Just in case you are interested in NATO phonetic alphabet, here are some facts about them.

     The NATO phonetic alphabet, officially denoted as the International Radiotelephony Spelling
     Alphabet, and also commonly known as the ICAO phonetic alphabet, and in a variation also known
     officially as the ITU phonetic alphabet and figure code, is the most widely used radiotelephone
     spelling alphabet. Although often called “phonetic alphabets”, spelling alphabets are unrelated to
     phonetic transcription systems such as the International Phonetic Alphabet. Instead, the
     International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) alphabet assigned codewords acrophonically to the
     letters of the English alphabet, so that critical combinations of letters and numbers are most
     likely to be pronounced and understood by those who exchange voice messages by radio or telephone,
     regardless of language differences or the quality of the communication channel

   Here are the 26 elements within the NATO phonetic alphabet list.
pilot_alpha = ['Alfa', 'Bravo', 'Charlie', 'Delta', 'Echo', 'Foxtrot', 'Golf', 'Hotel', 'India', 'Juliett', \
'Kilo', 'Lima', 'Mike', 'November', 'Oscar', 'Papa', 'Quebec', 'Romeo', 'Sierra', 'Tango', 'Uniform', 'Victor', \
'Whiskey', 'Xray', 'Yankee', 'Zulu']

   Below is the python program which will do the translation job.
import string

def to_nato(words):

    pilot_alpha = ['Alfa', 'Bravo', 'Charlie', 'Delta', 'Echo', 'Foxtrot', 'Golf', 'Hotel', 'India', 'Juliett', \
    'Kilo', 'Lima', 'Mike', 'November', 'Oscar', 'Papa', 'Quebec', 'Romeo', 'Sierra', 'Tango', 'Uniform', \
    'Victor', 'Whiskey', 'Xray', 'Yankee', 'Zulu']
    
    word_list = list(words)
    str = ''

    for char in word_list:
        alpha_index = (ord(char.upper()) - 65) # get the location of the pilot_alpha index
        if alpha_index in range(65):
            str += pilot_alpha[alpha_index] + " "
        elif char == " ":
            str += ""
        else:
            str += char + " "

    return str.strip()

   If you input “Hello World!!!” into the above function you will get below outcome.
