Given a list of numbers, find the one which is closest to zero
January 27, 2019

   Hello, after we have completed the video editing project we will continue to explore those websites
   that provide python programming training for free, one of those websites which we will explore today
   is called [14]codingame.com.

   This is the site which is about the same as the one we have visited previously, it offers game
   programming practice for those of you who want to become a game developer. I am still in the practice
   stage on this site and have just completed one of the questions on this site. If you are new to this
   site then you will find out that sometimes the question which the site asked is very confusing,
   actually it is not that hard to solve some of the problems but the site just does not give us exactly
   what it actually needs us to do which leaves us to figure it out the rest of the question by our
   self. Oh well, let us look at one of the problems from this site which I have solved.

   Given a list of readings from a thermometer, find the value which is closest to zero, if there are
   two values that are closet to 0 and equal to each other but have different attributes, for example -2
   and +2, then +2 will be the one which is closest to 0. If nothing is inside the list then just
   printed 0. Below is the solution for this question.

<code>
import sys
import math

a_list = [] # the list of readings
first = True
min_val = 0

for i in input().split():
    # t: a temperature expressed as an integer ranging from -273 to 5526
    t = int(i)
    a_list.append(t)

if(len(a_list) > 0):
    for x in a_list:
        if(first == True):
            min_val = x
            first = False
        elif(abs(x) <= abs(min_val)):
            if((abs(x) == abs(min_val) and x > min_val) or (abs(x) < abs(min_val))):
                min_val = x

    print (min_val)

else:
    print(0)
