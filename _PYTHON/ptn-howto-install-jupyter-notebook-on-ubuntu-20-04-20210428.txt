How to Install Jupyter Notebook on Ubuntu 20.04 / 18.04
April 21, 2021

   How to install Jupyter Notebook on Ubuntu 20.04 to share live code with others. In this guide, we'll
   show you how to Install Jupyter Notebook on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS. Here we show you simple ways to install
   Jupyter on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (Focal Fossa). You can follow the same instructions for Ubuntu 18.04,
   16.04 and any other Debian based distribution like Linux Mint and Elementary OS.

   Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share live code
   documents with others. Jupyter is a next-generation notebook interface. Jupyter supports more than 40
   programming languages including Python, R, Julia, and Scala.

Install Jupyter Notebook on Ubuntu
   The following steps to install Jupyter Notebook on your Ubuntu systems.

Step 1 Update and Upgrade Packages
   First, we always start our installations before we ensure our system is updated. Run the following
   command to update the APT list of available packages and their versions. Moreover, use the upgrade
   command to actually install newer versions of the packages.
$> sudo apt update && sudo apt -y upgrade

Step 2 Install Python
   Next you have to install Python 3, pip, and other required packages to build Python dependencies.
$> sudo apt install python3-pip python3-dev

Step 3 Install Python virtualenv
   Upgrade pip version and install Python virtualenv package.
$> sudo -H pip3 install --upgrade pip
$> sudo -H pip3 install virtualenv

   Note: Here, -H stands for security policy to set the home environment variable.

Step 4 Create Python Virtual Environment
   First you have to create a directory in your home directory (or any other location). This new
   directory is considered our code directory.
$> mkdir notebook

   Next you have to go to the directory and create a Python virtual environment called jupyterenv.
cd notebook
$> virtualenv jupyterenv

   Now we have to load and activate the virtual environment using the following command.
$> source jupyterenv/bin/activate

Step 5 Install Jupyter Notebook
   Write down the following command in your terminal to install Jupyter using pip.
$> pip install jupyter

Step 6 Run Jupyter Notebook
   We have installed all required packages and dependencies. Let's start to run the Jupyter Notebook.
   Run the following command.
$> jupyter notebook

   Here is a home screen of Jupyter.
   jupyter notebook homescreen jupyter notebook homescreen

   You have to click on the new menu and select Python3 or else you can select another option. It will
   create a new page in your browser of Jupyter.

Step 7 Create Jupyter Application Menu
   Create a new file called run-jupyter.sh in your notebook directory.
#!/bin/bash

source /home/username/jupyterenvironment/bin/activate
jupyter notebook

   Create a new file in /usr/share/applications called jupyter.desktop to create an application menu
   item.
[Desktop Entry]
Name=Jupyter Notebook
Exec=/home/username/notebook/run-jupyter.sh
Type=Application
Terminal=true
