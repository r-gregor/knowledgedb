Why is there no main() function in Python?
Originally Answered: Why there is no main() function in python?

Python was meant as a scripting language - you can just put statements in a file and run the file, in the
same way you would a bash script. In C you cannot have code outside of a function, this is just how the
language is designed.

The Python behavior can cause problems if you want your module to be importable, and also work as a stand
alone program; importing it would try to execute the stuff inside it.

But you can do this:

	def get_greeting(name): 
		return "Hello, {}!".format(name) 
	 
	def main(): 
		name = input("Enter your name: ") 
		print(get_greeting(name)) 
	 
	if __name__ == "__main__": 
		main() 

This way the code in main will only be called if this was the specific file to be executed; if it’s just
being imported (for example because somebody wants to use get_greeting), it won’t try to write and read to
the console.
