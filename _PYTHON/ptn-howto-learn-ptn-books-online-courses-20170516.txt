   How and where can I learn Python? What books, online courses, etc., are there?

***   
   Forget about books. That’s too slow. You might want to check out [17]An Introduction to Interactive
   Programming in Python (Part 1) | Coursera. It’s a fun little course. You learn the basics of Python
   by developing simple games.
   ...
    17. https://www.coursera.org/learn/interactive-python-1
    ...

   Other than that, I encourage you to download Python and start hacking away. Look up the syntax
   whenever you need to. The [18]Documentation and StackOverflow are your friends.

***
   There are many great source where you can learn python but choosing the best one is really hard.
   Beginning

   If you are a beginner then you must start learning by reading this book: [30]Learn Python The Hard
   Way. I read this book and I strongly recommend to everyone for those who are new to python. There you
   will be exposed to many basic concept of python and with many exercise which you must complete it and
   by the end of the book you will be quite familiar with python programming language. If you are not
   comfortable with book then try [31]Codecademy python tutorial. There is also [32]Google Python Class
   tutorial which is also great for starting so you can try this too.

   Getting familiar with python
   Now after all this you can try reading [33]Python Documentation for much deeper knowledge which is
   really great. Try to complete all the tutorials and you will get most of the things for starters.
   Also you can try [34]Tutorials point.

   Algorithms and data structures
   After learning everything, now you are ready to study some data structures. For this I strongly
   recommend this: [35]Problem Solving with Algorithms and Data Structures using Python. Its really a
   great site and the explanation is very detailed. Just complete this tutorial and you will be really
   good.

     * How to learn ?

   Now the main point which you must notice is that reading is not sufficient. From these sources you
   can surely learn a lot but How to learn is also a question.

   So to learn effectively you must do 2 things:
    1. Write one program daily
    2. Do some work on project

   Make some program in python everyday to brush up your skill. Try to solve some problems in
   competitive programming sites like Codechef, hackerrank, hackerearth, topcoder, SPOJ etc. Here you
   will get familiar with many basic concepts of python and you will learn basic implementation. If you
   are not sure from where to start then I recommend Hackerrank - Python challenge. Solve every question
   of it and by the end of that challenge you will become master.

   Now for project there are many options which you can choose. For example you can make projects
   related Scrapping or creating web app using Django, Flask. There are many many things which you can
   try, its up to you that what you want to do. Start searching and start working.

   Things you must follow while learning python:
    1. [36]Reddit Python - See what is trending and get some help
    2. [37]Stackoverflow - To ask question and get help
    ...

   If You Want to learn any programming language , Video Lectures are better than text book. Because
   it’s Practical right ?

   Actually starting to learn any language with free video tutorial available in the internet is not the
   best way because it might not cover all basic you need to learn as a beginner and is time consuming
   too. I prefer learning by Paid Online Course.

   Why Because , If Free ……..

   If you Get Any Doubts , how you clear that doubts ? did you compromise ?

   if you compromise ok , but companies can’t compromise to take good programmer , so why don’t you go
   with some online paid course in online.

   If you Get Any Doubts, Paid Course Instructors take care of your doubts until the completion of
   course in online.

   If it’s Free , you never take care about that, if you pay anything , then only you will defiantly pay
   attention on that subject , so better to go with online courses,

   Moto : First LEARN then EARN

   As Per My Experience i Recommend Some Online Python Course with affordable fee.

   I answered a question like this just a minute ago. I think the same answer would work just fine.

   If you are just starting as a beginner then I would recommend Learn Python Pro by sololearn. This app
   takes you step by step and teaches you all topics of python with small quizes after each lesson. It
   has a descussion section for Q&A, and also has a code playground to practice what you learn. I would
   highly recommend it. Very convenient.

   Learn Python Pro by Sololearn Inc

   [51]Learn Python Pro on the App Store

   Here is the app’s description.
   Not much more to say, when you can check it out for yourself.
   And also sololearn has more apps for other coding languages like html, css, javascript, and more if
   you are interested.
