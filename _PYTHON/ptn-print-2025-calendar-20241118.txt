How To Print 2025 Calendar Using Python

   Python is a versatile programming language that offers a wide range of built-in modules to simplify
   your coding tasks. One such module is the calendar module, which allows you to generate and customize
   calendars programmatically. In this article, you'll learn how to print a full-year 2025 calendar
   using Python. Whether you're creating a scheduling app or just need a quick reference for the year
   ahead, this guide will walk you through the process step by step.

Prerequisites
   Before diving into the code, make sure you have the following:
     * Python Installed: Ensure that Python is installed on your system. You can download it from the
       official Python website.
     * Basic Understanding of Python: Familiarity with basic Python syntax and modules will help you
       follow along more easily.

Introduction to Python's calendar Module
   The calendar module in Python provides various functions for generating and manipulating calendar
   data. It can display calendars for any month or year in text or HTML format and even allows
   customization of the first day of the week.

   Key Functions:
     * calendar.month(): Prints a specific month's calendar.
     * calendar.calendar(): Prints a full-year calendar.
     * calendar.setfirstweekday(): Sets the first day of the week (default is Monday).

   This module is widely used in applications that require date manipulation, such as scheduling systems
   or time management tools.

Step-by-Step Guide to Printing a 2025 Calendar

Step 1: Importing the calendar Module
   The first step is to import the calendar module into your Python script. This module comes
   pre-installed with Python, so there's no need for additional installation.
import calendar

Step 2: Generating a Full-Year Calendar for 2025
   You can generate a full-year calendar for 2025 using the calendar.calendar() function. This function
   returns a multi-line string representing the entire year's calendar.
year = 2025
print(calendar.calendar(year))

   This will output a neatly formatted text-based calendar for all 12 months of 2025. By default, it
   starts each week on Monday.

Step 3: Customizing the Calendar Layout
   The calendar.calendar() function allows you to customize how the calendar is displayed by adjusting
   parameters like column width and spacing between months.
print(calendar.calendar(2025, w=2, l=1, c=6, m=3))
     * w: Sets the width of date columns (default is 2).
     * l: Defines the number of lines per week (default is 1).
     * c: Controls space between month columns (default is 6).
     * m: Specifies how many months are displayed per row (default is 3).

   This flexibility allows you to format your output based on your specific needs.

Step 4: Setting the First Day of the Week
   The default starting day of the week is Monday in most regions. However, you can change this using
   the setfirstweekday() method. For example, if you prefer your weeks starting on Sunday:
calendar.setfirstweekday(calendar.SUNDAY)
print(calendar.calendar(2025))

   This will adjust all calendars generated afterward to start on Sunday instead of Monday.

Generating Monthly Calendars in Python

Printing a Specific Month's Calendar
   If you only need to display a specific month rather than an entire year, use the calendar.month()
   function. For example, here's how you can print January 2025:
print(calendar.month(2025, 1))

   This will output January's calendar with each day aligned under its respective weekday column.

Formatting Monthly Calendars with Custom Weekday Start
   You can also customize which day starts the week when printing individual months by creating an
   instance of TextCalendar(). Here's an example where Monday is set as the first day of January 2025:
tc = calendar.TextCalendar(firstweekday=calendar.MONDAY)
print(tc.formatmonth(2025, 1))

   This gives more control over formatting and allows you to adjust how each month's calendar looks
   based on your preferences.

Advanced Customization Options for Calendars in Python

Create HTML Calendars with HTMLCalendar()
   If you're working on web-based applications or need an HTML version of your calendar, Python's
   HTMLCalendar() class makes it easy to create HTML-formatted calendars. Here's an example that
   generates an HTML table for January 2025:
hc = calendar.HTMLCalendar(firstweekday=calendar.SUNDAY)
print(hc.formatmonth(2025, 1))

   This output can be directly embedded into web pages or saved as an HTML file for further use.

Troubleshooting Tip: Handling Leap Years and Invalid Input
   If you're generating calendars dynamically based on user input, it's important to handle leap years
   and invalid data gracefully. For instance, if users input February for a non-leap year like 2025,
   ensure that your program accounts for only 28 days.
try:
    year = int(input("Enter year: "))
    print(calendar.calendar(year))
except ValueError:
    print("Please enter a valid year.")

   This code snippet ensures that invalid input doesn't crash your program by catching errors like
   non-integer input values.

User Input: Dynamic Calendar Generation Based on User Input

User Prompt for Year Input
   You can make your script more interactive by allowing users to specify which year they want to
   generate a calendar for. Here's how you can prompt users for input:
year = int(input("Enter year: "))
print(calendar.calendar(year))

   This will print out the full-year calendar based on whatever year the user inputs.

Troubleshooting Common Issues When Printing Calendars in Python
     * Error Handling: If you're dealing with user input (like entering years), ensure proper error
       handling using try-except blocks as shown above.
     * Date Formatting Issues: If dates aren't aligning properly in custom layouts (especially when
       using HTMLCalendar), check parameters like column width (w) and line spacing (L) settings
       carefully.
