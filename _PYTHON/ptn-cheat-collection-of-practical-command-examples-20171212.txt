Cheat – A Collection Of Practical Linux Command Examples
December 7, 2017

   Many of us very often checks Man Pages to know about command switches (options), it shows you the
   details about command syntax, description, details, and available switches but it doesn’t has any
   practical examples. Hence, we are face some trouble to form a exact command format which we need.

   Are you really facing the trouble on this and want a better solution? i would advise you to check
   about cheat utility.

What Is Cheat
   Cheat allows you to create and view interactive cheatsheets on the command-line. It was designed
   to help remind *nix system administrators of options for commands that they use frequently, but not
   frequently enough to remember.

How to Install Cheat
   Cheat package was developed using python, so install pip package to install cheat on your system.

   For Debian/Ubuntu, use apt-get command or apt command to install pip.
[For Python2]
$ sudo apt install python-pip python-setuptools

[For Python3]
$ sudo apt install python3-pip

   pip doesn’t shipped with RHEL/CentOS system official repository so, enable EPEL Repository and
   use YUM command to install pip.
$ sudo yum install python-pip python-devel python-setuptools

   For Fedora system, use [45]dnf Command to install pip.
[For Python2]
$ sudo dnf install python-pip

[For Python3]
$ sudo dnf install python3

   For Arch Linux based systems, use [46]Pacman Command to install pip.

[For Python2]
$ sudo pacman -S python2-pip python-setuptools

[For Python3]

   pip is a python module bundled with setuptools, it’s one of the recommended tool for installing
   Python packages in Linux.
$ sudo pip install cheat

How to Use Cheat
   Run cheat followed by corresponding command to view the cheatsheet, For demonstration purpose, we are
   going to check about tar command examples.
$ cheat tar
# To extract an uncompressed archive:
tar -xvf /path/to/foo.tar

# To create an uncompressed archive:
tar -cvf /path/to/foo.tar /path/to/foo/

# To extract a .gz archive:
tar -xzvf /path/to/foo.tgz

# To create a .gz archive:
tar -czvf /path/to/foo.tgz /path/to/foo/

# To list the content of an .gz archive:
tar -ztvf /path/to/foo.tgz

# To extract a .bz2 archive:
tar -xjvf /path/to/foo.tgz

# To create a .bz2 archive:
tar -cjvf /path/to/foo.tgz /path/to/foo/

# To extract a .tar in specified Directory:
tar -xvf /path/to/foo.tar -C /path/to/destination/

# To list the content of an .bz2 archive:
tar -jtvf /path/to/foo.tgz

# To create a .gz archive and exclude all jpg,gif,... from the tgz
tar czvf /path/to/foo.tgz --exclude=\*.{jpg,gif,png,wmv,flv,tar.gz,zip} /path/to/foo/

# To use parallel (multi-threaded) implementation of compression algorithms:
tar -z ... -> tar -Ipigz ...
tar -j ... -> tar -Ipbzip2 ...
tar -J ... -> tar -Ipixz ...

   Run the following command to see what cheatsheets are available.
$ cheat -l
