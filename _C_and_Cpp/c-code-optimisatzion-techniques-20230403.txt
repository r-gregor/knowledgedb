- use profiler (Oprofiler, PTU ??)
- inlining functions
- eliminate condition checking using function pointers
- minimise conditionchecking (state machine?)
- Hot & Cold Data Separation
- loop unrolling
- data aligning
- lookup tables of precomputed values (greater speed)
- in-memory compression (better memory usage)
- obstacks or pool-alocator instead of heap
- initializations of large array at runtime (memset, ...)
- compare to 0 (decreased count)
- Use bitfields for storing bools
- re-use big global arrays by overlaying with a union
-  memory accesses that depend on other memory accesses (ie, a[b[c]]) are bad!
-  pack structures e.g. #pragma pack(1) and use bit fields in structures
