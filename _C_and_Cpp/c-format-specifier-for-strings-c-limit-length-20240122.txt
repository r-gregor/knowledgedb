Limiting the Length of C Format Specifiers for Strings
2023-07-12

In C, you cannot directly assign arrays, whether they are character strings or any other array type. For
strings that are terminated by '\0', you can use the strcpy function to copy one array to another,
or use strncpy to copy a part of one array to another, which is what you need in your case. The size
can still be specified in the format string as before. It is important to note that any warning about a
'non-constant format string' from certain compilers under specific sets of flags should be disregarded
or suppressed when using the generated format string.

Problems with limiting a string length in C

Solution 1:

The buffer for sizeof is required as a third argument for scanf_s .

scanf_s("%s", word, sizeof(word));

The scanf_s can vary between being Microsoft-specific or defined by the C standard, but it is not required
to be implemented in every C implementation. Depending on the choice, you will either need to cast the
argument to unsigned (for Microsoft implementation) or rsize_t (for C standard).

It is important to verify the return value of scanf_s .

if ( scanf_s("%s", word, (unsigned) sizeof(word)) != 1 ) {
	// error routine.
}

To ensure code portability, opt for using fgets() instead.

if ( !fgets(word, sizeof(word), stdin) ) {
   // error routine.
}

Solution 2:

Strings

C in programming uses an array of characters to represent strings.

To comply with the C standard library, it is necessary to terminate these arrays with a null character
( ). This is because the library assumes that strings will be written in this manner.

By defining the array char word[15] , you allocate sufficient memory to accommodate 14 characters along
with the null character.

Solution 3:

Ezoic The function scanf_s necessitates an additional argument to specify the size of the input buffer
for the conversion specifier s.

For instance, you could write (in the case of scanf_s being the Microsoft implementation).

scanf_s("%14s", word, ( unsigned )sizeof( word ) );

or (if it is the standard scanf_s)

scanf_s("%14s", word, ( rsize_t )sizeof( word ) );

Specify the length as sizeof( word ) - 1 , which is equivalent to 14 . Keep in mind that one character
is reserved for the terminating zero character, ' '.

C - scanf() variable length specifier:
void scan_string (char * buffer, unsigned length) {
	char format [12];

	// Support max int value for the format %<num>s
	snprintf (format, sizeof (format), "%%%ds", length - 1);

	// Generate format
	scanf (format, buffer);
}
int main () {
	char string [5];
	scan_string (string, sizeof(string));
	printf ("%s\n", string);
}

Limit Output in C
You can limit the length by setting the precision in the format specifier: printf("%.8s", str);
This will print up to eight characters from the null-terminated string pointed-to by
str. If the length of str is less than eight characters, then it will print the entire string.
Specifying the maximum string length to scanf dynamically in C (like "%*s" in printf)

Solution 1:

Basic answer

In scanf() , there is no equivalent to the format specifier printf() mentioned in *.

According to Kernighan and Pike in their book, The Practice of Programming, they suggest utilizing
snprintf() to generate the format string.

size_t sz = 64;
char format[32];
snprintf(format, sizeof(format), "%%%zus", sz);
if (scanf(format, buffer) != 1) { ...oops... }

Extra information

Enhancing the example to create a fully functional function.

int read_name(FILE *fp, char *buffer, size_t bufsiz) {
	char format[16];
	snprintf(format, sizeof(format), "%%%zus", bufsiz - 1);
	return fscanf(fp, format, buffer);
}

This highlights that the size specified in the format is one less than the actual buffer size, representing
the number of non-null characters that can be stored without including the terminating null. It is important
to note that this is different from fgets() , where the size (which incidentally is not a size_t ) refers
to the actual buffer size, without subtracting one. There are several ways to enhance the function,
but the main point is demonstrated. If desired, you can substitute the s in the format with [^ ] .

Additionally, according to the comments by Tim ÄŒas, if you desire to obtain the remaining part of
an input line, it is usually more advantageous to utilize fgets() for reading the line. Nevertheless,
keep in mind that this method includes the newline character in its output, whereas %63[^ ] retains the
newline for the subsequent I/O operation. When dealing with more comprehensive scanning, such as searching
for two or three strings, this technique may be more suitable, particularly when combined with fgets()
or getline() , and subsequently employing sscanf() to analyze the input.

The TR 24731-1 'safe' functions, which are implemented by Microsoft (to some extent), are standardized
in Annex K of ISO/IEC 9899-2011 (the C11 standard) and specifically require an explicit length.

if (scanf_s("%[^\n]", buffer, sizeof(buffer)) != 1)
	...oops...

This avoids buffer overflows may result in an error when the input is too lengthy. The size can be
specified in the format string as previously done: """.

if (scanf_s("%63[^\n]", buffer, sizeof(buffer)) != 1)
	...oops...
if (scanf_s(format, buffer, sizeof(buffer)) != 1)
	...oops...

Please disregard or suppress the warning regarding the 'non-constant format string' from certain compilers
with specific flags for code that utilizes the format string generated.

Solution 2:

The scanf family of functions does not provide a variable width specifier. One option is to generate the
format string dynamically (although this may not be necessary if the width is constant at compile time)
or to accept the fixed width. Another approach could be to utilize preprocessor macros to define the
width of both the buffer and format string.

#define STR_VALUE(x) STR(x)
#define STR(x) #x
#define MAX_LEN 63
char buffer[MAX_LEN + 1];
fscanf(file, "%" STR_VALUE(MAX_LEN) "[^\n]", buffer);

Solution 3:

One alternative is to adjust the length of the string by utilizing #define .

#define STRING_MAX_LENGTH "%10s"

or

#define DOUBLE_LENGTH "%5f"

Can maximum number of characters be defined in C, This is not an answer on how to use string.format,
but another way of shortening a string using extension methods. This way enables you to add the max
length to the string directly, even without string.format.
Having issues on assigning a word to length

Solution 1:

The mistake is in the line

name2 = name[length2];

The goal is to assign a character, specifically the one at index length2 inside name , to an array named
name2 .

The action you truly desire is to perform this.

strncpy(name2, name, length2);
name2[length2] = '\0';

The first length2 bytes of name are copied into name2 , with the addition of a terminating null character
for safety. However, strncpy does not add the null character if all bytes are already written.

If you have no plans to utilize name in the future, it may be beneficial to eliminate name2 entirely
and append a null character to name :

name[length2] = '\0';

On the final call, it is advised to utilize the %s instead of the %c format specifier when printing a
string using the printf .

Solution 2:

Some suggestions from previous responses have discussed the creation of a duplicate of the initial
substring in your input or the modification of the input string directly. These approaches are effective
and have various applications in practical programming scenarios.

If your program only requires printing the desired substring, there is no need for any string
manipulation. The task can be accomplished solely with printf using the given variables and code you
declared.

scanf("%s", name);
length = strlen(name);
printf("The word's length is: %d\n", length);
printf("Enter a smaller number than the length: ");
scanf("%d", &length2);

... you have the option of utilizing a format specified as printf to output name into a field with a
predetermined length, which is determined by an additional printf argument.

printf("%.*s\n", length2, name);

Typically, one would want to include a newline after as well, although it can be omitted based on
personal preference.

The formatting directive uses .* to indicate the specification of a "precision" for the field using
an printf argument. Different formats can directly express a fixed precision. The importance of the
precision varies depending on the directive type, but for s directives, it represents the maximum number
of characters to be printed from the related string argument.

Solution 3:

Your code contains two primary errors, along with a few minor points.

In C, it is not possible to directly assign arrays, whether they are character strings or any other array
type. For arrays terminated with nul , such as strings, you can use the strcpy function to copy one array
to another, or use strncpy to copy a portion of one array to another. This is the desired functionality
for your case.

Furthermore, the format specifier %c cannot be utilized to print a string; instead, %s should be used
for that purpose.

Additionally, it is important for programmers to note that functions dealing with string lengths, such
as strlen and strncpy , typically operate on size_t types rather than int . Consequently, programmers
need to utilize the %zu format specifier instead of %d .

Below is an alternative code version that achieves the desired outcome.

#include
#include
#define DIM 99
int main() {
	char name[DIM], name2[DIM] = { 0 }; // Fill with zeros to start, so we will have a nul terminator
	size_t length, length2; // Strictly, use "size_t" for "strlen" and "strncpy"
	printf("Enter a word: ");
	scanf("%s", name);
	length = strlen(name);
	printf("The word's length is: %zu\n", length); // Use "%zu" for the "size_t" type
	printf("Enter a smaller number than the length: ");
	scanf("%zu", &length2); //Again, "%zu" for "size_t"
	strncpy(name2, name, length2); // Use this function to copy a substring!
	printf("The word cut on the letter %zu is: %s", length2, name2);// Note that you need "%s" to print a string

	return 0;
}

To avoid buffer overruns and other faults, you can incorporate additional safety measures into your
code. For instance, you can restrict the initial string input to a maximum of DIM - 1 characters. If DIM
were replaced with a hard-coded value of 99 , implementing this restriction would be straightforward. In
such a case, you could utilize a call similar to the following:

scanf("%98s", name); // Read at most 98 characters (leaving space for the nul-terminator)

The macro DIM is not allowed within the quoted format string. Instead, you can store its value (minus 1)
in a different string and use that as the format argument for scanf . Therefore, we modify our original
scanf call as follows:

//	scanf("%s", name); // This has the potential to overrun the "name" array!
	char fmt[8];
	sprintf(fmt, "%%%ds", DIM - 1); // Write "%98s" into the "fmt" string ...
	scanf(fmt, name);				// ...and use that for the "scanf" format

Please note that while some compilers may issue warnings about not using a string literal for the format
argument and some programmers may disapprove of this approach, it is still considered valid and legal in
C programming, in my humble opinion. The suggested use of the scanf function falls within these parameters.
Formatting a string into multiple lines of a specific, take a function for your work like:

void put_multiline(const char *s, int width) {
	int n,i=0;
	char t [100];
	while ( 1==sscanf (s,"%99s%n",t,&n) ) {
		if( i+strlen(t)>width ) puts (""),i=0;
		printf ("%s%s",i?++i," ":"",t);
		i+=strlen (t);
		s+=n;
	}
}

strtok will destroy your string, this solution not.
