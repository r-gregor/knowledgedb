POINTER TO AN ARRAY
Feb 23, 2024

Why might we need pointers when working with arrays in C, and how do pointers enhance our ability to
manipulate array elements effectively?

Pointer to array(s) in C allow you to work with arrays through a pointer, providing a way to manipulate
and traverse the array more efficiently.

C provide a way to work with arrays using pointers, allowing for more flexible and efficient manipulation
of array elements.

Let's take a look at this program:

#include<stdio.h>

int main() {
	int number[5] = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };
	int *Numberptr = number;

	printf("%p\n", Numberptr);
	return 0;
}

In the program mentioned earlier, there's a pointer named 'Numberptr' that points to the first
element (0th element) of the array.

*** Likewise, we can declare a pointer that has the ability to point to the entire array instead of just one
element. Such a pointer becomes handy, especially when dealing with multidimensional arrays. ***

Syntax
data_type (*variable_name)[size_of_array];

- data_type: This is the type of data that the array holds.
- (*variable_name): This declares a pointer variable. The parentheses are necessary to ensure that the pointer
  points to an array and not to a single element.
- [size_of_array]: This indicates the size of the array to which the pointer will point.

For example, if you want to declare a pointer to an array of integers with a size of 5:
int (*ptr)[5];

This pointer, ptr, can now point to an array of integers with a size of 5.

The pointer that points to the 0th element of array and the pointer that points to the whole array are
totally different. Let's break it down with an example:

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
	int arr[5] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};

	// Pointer to the 0th element
	int *ptrToElement = arr;

	// Pointer to the whole array
	int (*ptrToArray)[5] = &arr;

	// Accessing the 0th element using the pointer to element
	printf("Value at 0th element: %d\n", *ptrToElement);

	// Accessing the entire array using the pointer to the array
	for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
		printf("Value at index %d: %d\n", i, (*ptrToArray)[i]);
	}

	return 0;
}

OUTPUT

Value at 0th element: 10
Value at index 0: 10
Value at index 1: 20
Value at index 2: 30
Value at index 3: 40
Value at index 4: 50

In this program, ptrToElement is a pointer that points to the 0th element of the array arr. It can be
used to access individual elements in the array.

On the other hand, ptrToArray is a pointer that points to the entire array. This type of pointer is useful
when dealing with multidimensional arrays or passing arrays to functions. The syntax (*ptrToArray)[5]
indicates that this pointer is pointing to an array of size 5.

The program then demonstrates the difference by accessing the 0th element using ptrToElement and printing
the entire array using ptrToArray. It then uses ptrToArray to access and print each element of the
array in a loop. The key point is that these two pointers have different purposes and should be used
accordingly based on the intended operation.

In C, you can use the sizeof operator to illustrate the sizes of pointers to arrays. Here's a simple
program that demonstrates this:

//C program to demonstrate the sizes of array pointers.
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
	int arr1[5];
	char arr2[5];

	int (*ptrToIntArr)[5] = &arr1;
	char (*ptrToCharArr)[5] = &arr2;

	printf("Size of pointer to int array: %lu bytes\n", sizeof(ptrToIntArr));
	printf("Size of pointer to char array: %lu bytes\n", sizeof(ptrToCharArr));

	return 0;
}

Size of pointer to int array: 8 bytes
Size of pointer to char array: 8 bytes

In this program:
    arr1 is an array of integers.
    arr2 is an array of characters.

We declare pointers to arrays (ptrToIntArr and ptrToCharArr), and then use sizeof to print the sizes of
these pointers.

When you run this program, it will output the sizes of the pointers to the respective arrays in bytes. Note
that the size of a pointer depends on the architecture of the system (e.g., 4 bytes on a 32-bit system
and 8 bytes on a 64-bit system).

So answering the question asked earlier, pointers in C enhance array manipulation by providing efficient
memory access, enabling dynamic allocation, facilitating passing arrays to functions, and simplifying
operations on array elements, especially in multidimensional arrays.
