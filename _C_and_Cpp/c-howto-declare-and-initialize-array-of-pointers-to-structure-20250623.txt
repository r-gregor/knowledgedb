How to Declare and Initialize an Array of Pointers to a Structure in C?
28 Nov, 2022

   In C language, arrays are made to store similar types of data in contiguous memory locations. We can
   make arrays of either primitive data types, like int, char, or float, or user-defined data types like
   Structures and Unions. We can also make arrays of pointers in C language. Today we will learn how to
   create arrays of Structure Pointers or pointers-to-structure in C language, both Statically and
   Dynamically.

Creating structure pointer arrays(Static Arrays)

i). 1D Arrays
   We can statically allocate memory for 1D and 2D arrays in C language. The static memory is allocated
   in the stack memory. We can do static memory allocation of structure pointers in the following ways:

   Step 1 - Declaring and initializing 1D arrays
   Let's say we have a structure "node", and we created different pointers to this structure. Now, to
   make a 1D array of those pointers in static memory, we must follow the following syntax:

   Syntax:
<struct_name> *<array_name>[ <size_of_array> ] ; // Declaration
<array_name>[ <index_number> ] = <pointer_to_the_structure> ; // Initialization

   We can access the pointers inside our array just like we access normal array elements. There is just
   a little bit of modification that we need to use the arrow operator to access the data present inside
   our structure pointer.

   Step 2 - Accessing the pointers within the array
   Syntax:
<array_name>[<index_number>]-><data to be accessed which is present inside the structure >

   Example:
// C Program to implement
// structure pointer arrays
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

typedef struct node {
	int number;
	char character;
} node;

int main(void) {
	// First pointer to structure
	node *structure_ptr1 = (node *)malloc(sizeof(node));

	// Second pointer to structure
	node *structure_ptr2 = (node *)malloc(sizeof(node));

	// Declaration of
	// structure-pointer-array of size 2
	node *struct_array[2];

	// Initializing structure pointers
	structure_ptr1->number    = 100;
	structure_ptr1->character = 'a';

	structure_ptr2->number    = 200;
	structure_ptr2->character = 'b';

	// Initializing this array with pointers
	struct_array[0] = structure_ptr1;
	struct_array[1] = structure_ptr2;

	// Printing data of structures
	printf("Data:\n");
	printf("%d and %c\n", struct_array[0]->number, struct_array[0]->character);
	printf("%d and %c\n", struct_array[1]->number, struct_array[1]->character);

	return 0;
}

   Output
Data:
100 and a
200 and b

   In the above example, we have a structure called a "node". We made 2 pointers to that structure
   namely- 'structure_ptr1' and 'structure_ptr2' and initialized them. After this, we declared an array
   - "struct_array" of size 2 and initialized it with our struct pointers.

ii). 2D Arrays
   Step 1 -  Declaring and initializing 2D arrays
   Syntax:
<structure_name> *<array_name>[number_of_rows][number_of_columns];
<array_name>[row_number][column_number] = <pointer_to_structure> ;

Step 2- Accessing elements of our 2D array
   Syntax:
< array_name >[ <row_number> ][ <column_number> ]-><data to be accessed which is present inside the structure >;

   Example:
// C Program to implement
// structure pointer 2-D array
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

typedef struct node {
	int number;
	char character;
} node;

int main(void) {
	// First pointer to structure
	node *structure_ptr1 = (node*)malloc(sizeof(node));

	// Second pointer to structure
	node *structure_ptr2 = (node*)malloc(sizeof(node));

	// Third pointer to structure
	node *structure_ptr3 = (node*)malloc(sizeof(node));

	// Fourth pointer to structure
	node *structure_ptr4 = (node*)malloc(sizeof(node));

	// Declaration of
	// structure-pointer-array
	// of size 2 X 2
	node *structure_array[2][2];

	// Initializing structure pointers
	structure_ptr1->number = 100;
	structure_ptr1->character = 'a';

	structure_ptr2->number = 200;
	structure_ptr2->character = 'b';

	structure_ptr3->number = 300;
	structure_ptr3->character = 'c';

	structure_ptr4->number = 400;
	structure_ptr4->character = 'd';

	// Initializing this array with pointers
	structure_array[0][0] = structure_ptr1;
	structure_array[0][1] = structure_ptr2;
	structure_array[1][0] = structure_ptr3;
	structure_array[1][1] = structure_ptr4;

	// Accessing the values of these structure pointers from
	// 2D array
	printf("Data:\n");
	for (int i = 0; i < 2; i++) {
		for (int j = 0; j < 2; j++) {
			printf("%c - ", structure_array[i][j]->character);
			printf("%d\t\t", structure_array[i][j]->number);
		}
		printf("\n");
	}
}

   Output
Data:
a - 100        b - 200
c - 300        d - 400

   So this is how we declare and initialize a 2D array of structure pointers. Here, we use the same
   structure - "node" and made 4 pointers for it which were - "structure_ptr1", "structure_ptr2",
   "structure_ptr3" and "structure_ptr4". After that, we declared a 2D array of size - 2 X 2 namely -
   structure_array.

     Note: The data type of the array must be the same as that of the structure followed by *
     (asterisk) sign, which signifies array of structure pointers.

Creating structure pointer arrays (Dynamic Arrays)
i). 1D Arrays
   As we know that in C language, we can also dynamically allocate memory for our variables or arrays.
   The dynamically allocated variables or arrays are stored in Heap. To dynamically allocate memory for
   structure pointer arrays, one must follow the following syntax:

   Syntax:
< structure_name > **< array_name > = <structure_name **> malloc ( sizeof( <structure_name> ) * size ) ;

   Notice the double-pointer after the structure name and during typecasting malloc to the structure.
   This double pointer is necessary because we are pointing to an array of structure pointers, and we
   know that we use double pointers if we want to point to another pointer.

   Example:
// C Program to implement
// Dynamic Array of structure
// pointer
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

typedef struct node {
	int number;
	char character;
} node;

int main(void) {
	// First pointer to structure
	node *structure_ptr1 = (node*)malloc(sizeof(node));

	// Second pointer to structure
	node *structure_ptr2 = (node*)malloc(sizeof(node));

	// Third pointer to structure
	node *structure_ptr3 = (node*)malloc(sizeof(node));

	// Fourth pointer to structure
	node *structure_ptr4 = (node*)malloc(sizeof(node));

	// Initializing structure pointers

	structure_ptr1->number = 100;
	structure_ptr1->character = 'a';

	structure_ptr2->number = 200;
	structure_ptr2->character = 'b';

	structure_ptr3->number = 300;
	structure_ptr3->character = 'c';

	structure_ptr4->number = 400;
	structure_ptr4->character = 'd';

	// Declaring the array dynamically for structure
	// pointers

	// Note that double pointer is
	// used for pointer to pointer
	node **structure_array = (node **)malloc(sizeof(node) * 4);

	// Initializing the array of structure pointers

	structure_array[0] = structure_ptr1;
	structure_array[1] = structure_ptr2;
	structure_array[2] = structure_ptr3;
	structure_array[3] = structure_ptr4;

	// Accessing dynamic 1D arrays - just like static 1D
	// arrays
	printf("Data:\n");
	for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
		printf("%c - ", structure_array[i]->character);
		printf("%d\t\t", structure_array[i]->number);
		printf("\n");
	}
}

   Output
Data:
a - 100
b - 200
c - 300
d - 400

   You can clearly see in the above code how we have initialized the structure pointer array at the end.
   The difference between this and static arrays is just that static arrays are allocated in stack
   memory, while these are allocated in heap memory. And so, you can resize these arrays anytime you
   want.

   We can access these arrays just like we did with the static ones so there is no change in syntax for
   that.

   # Note: In case of static arrays, you can initialize the array all at once during the time of    #
   # initialization like -  node *struct_arr[10] = { struct_ptr1, struct_ptr2, struct_ptr3 ..... }, #
   # whereas dynamically allocated arrays need to be initialized index-by-index.                    #
   ##################################################################################################

ii).  2D Arrays
   To allocate dynamic 2D arrays of pointers, first, we will create a 1D array dynamically and then will
   create sub-arrays at each index of that 1D array (basically an array of arrays containing pointers).
   Now, this requires the use of triple-pointers. We will understand this with the help of a diagram:

Pointer to an Array of
Arrays Containing Pointers    Array of Arrays
            |                      |
            |                      |
            V                      V        str_arr[0][0] str_arr[0][1] str_arr[0][2]     Arrays Containing
       ***str_arr ----> at_arr[0] [ ] ----> [ *str_ptr1 ] [ *str_ptr2 ] [ *str_ptr3 ]<--- Structure Pointers
                                   |
                                   |
                                   |        str_arr[1][0] str_arr[1][1] str_arr[1][2]
                        at_arr[1] [ ] ----> [ *str_ptr4 ] [ *str_ptr5 ] [ *str_ptr6 ]
                                   |
                                   |
                                   |        str_arr[2][0] str_arr[2][1] str_arr[2][2]
                        at_arr[2] [ ] ----> [ *str_ptr7 ] [ *str_ptr8 ] [ *str_ptr9 ]

                             Dynamic Pointer Array of Structures

   Explanation of the above figure:
     - ***st_arr is a triple pointer used to access the 2D array of structure pointers. Now, it is made
       a triple pointer because we are accessing those arrays, whose each element has a pointer to
       another array (subarray). And each element of those sub-arrays, have a pointer to the structure.
     - Each index of st_arr[i] contains sub-arrays.
     - Each index of sub-arrays - st_arr[i][j] contains a pointer to the structure.
     - st_ptr is a pointer to the structure.

   Example:
// C Program to implement
// 2D arrays of structure
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

typedef struct node {
	int number;
	char character;
} node;

int main(void) {
	// First pointer to structure
	node *st_ptr1 = (node *)malloc(sizeof(node));

	// Second pointer to structure
	node *st_ptr2 = (node *)malloc(sizeof(node));

	// Third pointer to structure
	node *st_ptr3 = (node *)malloc(sizeof(node));

	// Fourth pointer to structure
	node *st_ptr4 = (node *)malloc(sizeof(node));

	// Initializing structure pointers
	st_ptr1->number = 100;
	st_ptr1->character = 'a';

	st_ptr2->number = 200;
	st_ptr2->character = 'b';

	st_ptr3->number = 300;
	st_ptr3->character = 'c';

	st_ptr4->number = 400;
	st_ptr4->character = 'd';

	// Declaring the array dynamically for structure
	// pointers    Step - 1
	// Note that double pointer is
	// used for pointer to pointer
	node ***structure_array = (node ***)malloc(sizeof(node ***) * 2);

	// Used double pointers, at each index to point to
	// arrays of structure pointers - Step 2
	for (int i = 0; i < 2; i++) {
		structure_array[i] = (node **)malloc(sizeof(node **));
	}

	// Initializing the array of structure pointers   - Step
	// 3
	structure_array[0][0] = st_ptr1;
	structure_array[0][1] = st_ptr2;
	structure_array[1][0] = st_ptr3;
	structure_array[1][1] = st_ptr4;

	// Printing the values of these structure pointers from
	// array
	printf("Data:\n");
	for (int i = 0; i < 2; i++) {
		for (int j = 0; j < 2; j++) {
			printf("%c - ",
					structure_array[i][j]->character);
			printf("%d\t\t", structure_array[i][j]->number);
		}
		printf("\n");
	}
}

   Output
a - 100        b - 200
c - 300        d - 400

     * In the above code, as we have already discussed that triple pointer was used to point to an array
       of arrays containing structure pointers.
     * In the second step, we used double pointers as we had to use a pointer, which could point to an
       array of structure pointers.
     * In the third step, we initialized our dynamic 2D array, just like the static 2D array, index by
       -index.
