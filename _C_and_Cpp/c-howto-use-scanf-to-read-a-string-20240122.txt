How do you use scanf to read a string?"

As Joseph Newcomer stated in his [**1]answer, it is not recommended to use scanf for *anything*, especially
to read a string due to the simple fact that if one does not specify a maximum length, then there is a
distinct risk of a buffer overflow - I'd recommend that you use getline()[1]
instead.

If you *must* use scanf to read a string, then make sure that you specify a maximum length in the format /
conversion string that is the same size or smaller ( including the null terminator ) than the string or
buffer into which you're reading.

For example :

#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
	char *s1;
	if ((s1 = (char *) malloc(sizeof(char)*11)) == NULL) {
		puts("Error allocating memory for string buffer... aborting");
		return(EXIT_FAILURE);
	}

	puts("Please enter a string at most ten characters in length : ");

	if ((scanf("%10s", s1)) == EOF) { /* The 10 in %10s limits the input string to ten characters, not
		                               *including the null terminator (which is why malloc() allocated 11 bytes
		                               * instead of 10).
		                               */
		puts("ERROR : Invalid input");
		free(s1);
		return(EXIT_FAILURE);
	}
	puts("Input string was : ");
	puts(s1);
	free(s1);
	return(EXIT_SUCCESS);
}

How do you use scanf to read a string?

You don't. You don't use scanf for anything. It is a function that is so bad that if it didn't
already exist, nobody would want to invent it. It is dangerous to use, unreliable, and meaningless if
the data is not perfect. If you are using it, this is a colossal mistake. Don't do it. I think the
last time I used it was in 1976, It was so bad I have never used it since. It should never be used for
any programming, and banned by law, perhaps the EPA should limit its use because it is toxic..
