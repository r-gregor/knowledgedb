C program to swap two numbers using bitwise operator
July 20, 2025

   Write a C program to input any two numbers from user and swap values of both numbers using bitwise
   operator. How to swap two number using bitwise operator in C programming. Logic to swap two numbers
   using bitwise operator in C programming.

   Example

   Input
Input first number: 22
Input second number: 65

   Output
First number after swapping: 65
Second number after swapping: 22

Logic to swap two numbers using bitwise operator
   There are tons of discussions going around the internet to swap two numbers without using temporary
   variable (third variable). We can use bitwise XOR ^ operator to swap to numbers. Bitwise XOR operator
   evaluates each bit of the result to 1 if corresponding bits of the operands are different otherwise
   evaluates 0.

   Suppose two integer values a and b
   Perform, x = a ^ b
   Now x ^ b will evaluate to a
   and x ^ a will evaluate to b

   a   0001 1010         b   0100 0001          a   0001 1010
   b ^ 0100 0001         x ^ 0101 1011          x ^ 0101 1011
   -------------         -------------          -------------
   x   0101 1011         a   0001 1010          b   0100 0001

Program to swap two numbers

/**
 * C program to swap two numbers using bitwise operator
 */

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
	int num1, num2;

	/* Input two numbers from user */
	printf("Enter any two numbers: ");
	scanf("%d%d", &num1, &num2);

	printf("Original value of num1 = %d\n", num1);
	printf("Original value of num2 = %d\n", num2);

	/* Swap two numbers */
	num1 ^= num2;
	num2 ^= num1;
	num1 ^= num2;

	printf("Num1 after swapping = %d\n", num1);
	printf("Num2 after swapping = %d\n", num2);

	return 0;
}

   Output
Enter any two numbers: 22
65
Original value of num1 = 22
Original value of num2 = 65
Num1 after swapping = 65
Num2 after swapping = 22
