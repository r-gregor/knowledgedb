Understanding _Atomic Types in C
Feb 13, 2025

   In modern C programming, concurrency is becoming increasingly important as applications leverage
   multi-core processors. To safely share data between threads without causing race conditions, C
   introduced _Atomic types with the C11 standard. This article explores the concept of _Atomic types in
   C, their usage, and the difference between _Atomic typename and _Atomic(typename).

What Are _Atomic Types?
   _Atomic types in C provide a way to perform atomic operations on variables. Atomic operations are
   indivisible, meaning they cannot be interrupted by other threads, ensuring data integrity in
   concurrent applications.

Why Use _Atomic?
     * Data Consistency: Guarantees that variables are updated consistently across multiple threads.
     * Thread Safety: Avoids race conditions by making operations atomic.
     * Performance: More efficient than using mutexes or other synchronization mechanisms for simple
       operations.

Declaring _Atomic Types
   There are two ways to declare _Atomic types in C:
    1. _Atomic typename
    2. _Atomic(typename)

   Both are valid, but they differ slightly in syntax and usage.

1. _Atomic typename
   This syntax is straightforward and is typically used when declaring variables:
_Atomic int counter;

   Explanation:
     * The _Atomic keyword precedes the typename (in this case, int).
     * The compiler ensures that operations on counter are atomic.

   Example:
#include <stdatomic.h>
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
	_Atomic int counter = 0;

    atomic_fetch_add(&counter, 1);    // Atomically increments counter
	printf("Counter: %d\n", counter);

	return 0;
}
     * In this example, counter is an atomic integer. The function atomic_fetch_add performs an atomic
       increment.

2. _Atomic(typename)
   This form is used when you need a pointer to an atomic type or to define complex types:
_Atomic(int) counter;

   Explanation:
     * Here, the typename is enclosed in parentheses.
     * This form is particularly useful for pointers or when used in typedef.

   Example:
#include <stdatomic.h>
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
	_Atomic(int) counter = 0;

	atomic_store(&counter, 10);  // Atomically stores the value 10
	printf("Counter: %d\n", atomic_load(&counter));

	return 0;
}
     * This example does the same as the previous one but uses _Atomic(int) for declaration.

Key Differences between _Atomic typename and _Atomic(typename)
   Example of _Atomic(typename) with Pointers:
_Atomic(int) *ptr;
     * This declares ptr as a pointer to an atomic integer. The pointer itself is not atomic, but the
       data it points to is.

Atomic Operations
   C11 provides several atomic operations in the <stdatomic.h> header:
     * atomic_store() and atomic_load() - For storing and loading values atomically.
     * atomic_fetch_add() and atomic_fetch_sub() - For atomic addition and subtraction.
     * atomic_compare_exchange_strong() and atomic_compare_exchange_weak() - For atomic compare-and-swap
       operations.

Example of Atomic Compare-and-Swap

#include <stdatomic.h>
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
	_Atomic int value = 42;
	int expected = 42;
	int desired = 100;

	if (atomic_compare_exchange_strong(&value, &expected, desired)) {
		printf("Value updated to %d\n", value);
	} else {
		printf("Update failed, value is %d\n", value);
	}

	return 0;
}
     * atomic_compare_exchange_strong() checks if value is equal to expected. If true, it updates value
       to desired.
     * This is useful for implementing lock-free algorithms.

When to Use Which Form?
     * Use _Atomic typename for simple variable declarations where no pointers are involved.
     * Use _Atomic(typename) for pointers, typedefs, or complex types where more flexibility is needed.

Example with Typedef
typedef _Atomic(int) atomic_int_t;
atomic_int_t counter = 0;
     * This makes the code cleaner and more maintainable.

Memory Ordering
   Atomic operations in C11 also support memory ordering, which controls how operations on memory are
   perceived by other threads. The following memory orders are available:
     * memory_order_relaxed
     * memory_order_consume
     * memory_order_acquire
     * memory_order_release
     * memory_order_acq_rel
     * memory_order_seq_cst

   Example:
atomic_store_explicit(&counter, 1, memory_order_release);
     * Here, memory_order_release ensures that all previous writes are visible to other threads before
       the store.

Best Practices
     * Use _Atomic types for shared variables in multithreaded environments to prevent race conditions.
     * Choose between _Atomic typename and _Atomic(typename) based on simplicity and flexibility
       requirements.
     * Be mindful of memory ordering to avoid subtle concurrency bugs.

Conclusion
   Atomic types in C provide a robust mechanism for writing thread-safe code. By understanding the
   difference between _Atomic typename and _Atomic(typename), developers can write more efficient and
   maintainable concurrent programs. The choice between the two largely depends on the complexity of the
   type being declared and the specific use case.

   This introduction to _Atomic types serves as a foundation for exploring more advanced concurrent
   programming techniques in C. Whether you are writing lock-free algorithms or simply ensuring data
   consistency across threads, mastering _Atomic types is an essential skill for modern C programmers.
