Exploring Array of Pointers in C - A Detailed Guide
September 13, 2024

   In the realm of C programming, the concepts of Array and pointers are not just basic. They are
   crucial. Pointers, in particular, offer a significant advantage by enabling swift data access. This
   fusion of arrays and pointers allows for efficient manipulation of data within arrays. This concept
   also extends to multidimensional arrays and creating arrays of pointers to manage various kinds of
   data, making it a topic of utmost importance for any C programmer or student.

An Array of Pointers in C language
   Arrays and Pointers in the C language have a very strong relationship. Pointers are variables that
   contain the addresses of some other variables, and with arrays, a pointer stores the starting address
   of the array. If the pointer variable stores the base address of an array, then we can manipulate all
   the array elements using the pointer variable only. We can also create an array of pointers to store
   multiple addresses of different variables.

What is an Array?
   An array is a data structure that allows you to store the data in the same type. These elements can
   be accessed using an index, which represents their position within the array. Arrays are commonly
   used for storing and manipulating elements in the C language.

   Syntax of the Array
type arrayName[arraySize];

What is a Pointer?
   A pointer variable stores the address of another variable. Pointers are powerful tools that allow
   direct memory access and manipulation.

   The following program demonstrates the Pointer
int var = 10;
int *p;
p = &var;

What is an Array of Pointers in C language?
   An array of Pointers. Pointer arrays commonly contain different pointer variables.  We can create
   individual pointer variables that point to various value ranges, or we can create a single integer
   array of pointers that point to all available values.

   Syntax
   In C language, array elements are denoted as arr[i], where i is the index value. Below is the similar
   syntax used in the pointer.

   *(arr+i) ;
     - * asterisk for the dereferencing operator for extracting the value from the address
     - *(arr+i) is the same as arr[i] in a C program.
     - arr represents the array name i represents the index value.

   The following program demonstrates the array of pointers in C language:

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
	int arr[5] = {234, 343, 6234, 343, 105}, i;
	for(i = 0; i < 5; i++){
		printf("[index %d] Address : %u, Value : %d\n", i, (arr + i), *(arr + i));
	}

	return 0;
}


   Output
[index 0] Address : 2485226688, Value : 234
[index 1] Address : 2485226692, Value : 343
[index 2] Address : 2485226696, Value : 6234
[index 3] Address : 2485226700, Value : 343
[index 4] Address : 2485226704, Value : 105

Array of Pointers to Character
   We can also use an array of pointers for storing multiple strings as an array of pointers to
   characters. Here, each pointer in the array is a character pointer that points to the first character
   of the string in the array.

   Syntax
char *array_name[array_size];

   We can assign a string of any length to these pointers.
   The following program demonstrates the Array of Pointers to Characters

#include<stdio.h>

int main() {
	// Declaring an array of pointers to characters
	char *names[] = {"Neeraj", "Harry Potter", "Voldemort", "Computer", "voldemort"
	};

	// Accessing and printing the second name
	printf("%s\n", names[0]);
	printf("%s\n", names[1]);
	printf("%s\n", names[2]);
	printf("%s\n",names[3]) ;

	return 0;
}


   Output
Neeraj
Harry Potter
Voldemort
Computer

   In the above C program, we have declared five pointers. Each pointer in the C array points to the
   start of a string. The string "Neeraj" is pointed to by names[0] ,  and "Harry Pointer" by names [2].
   By indexing into an array, we can access and manipulate individual strings very easily.

   The following program defined the array size before initializing the array of pointers:

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
	char *arr[3] = { "Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday" };
	for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
		printf("%s\n", arr[i]);
	}

	return 0;
}


   Output
Monday
Tuesday
Wednesday

Memory Representation of an Arrays of Strings
    1. Arrays of Pointers: An array of pointers to hold strings means you're essentially reserving space
       in memory for the pointers, not the actual strings. Each element of this array is a pointer.
       Typically of size 4 bytes for a 32-bit system or 8 bytes for a 64-bit system. Which stores the
       address of the locations where the actual strings begin.
    2. Actual Strings:  The strings themselves reside in different parts of memory locations. They
       initialize the array of pointers with string literals (like "Neeraj" or "John") These literals
       are typically stored in a read-only section of memory.

   The following image describes the memory representation of an Array of Strings.

             0    1    2    3    4    5    6    7    8    9
   arr[0]  [ J ][ o ][ h ][ n ][ \0][   ][   ][   ][   ][   ]
   arr[1]  [ J ][ a ][ n ][ e ][ \0][   ][   ][   ][   ][   ]
   arr[2]  [ D ][ o ][ e ][ \0][   ][   ][   ][   ][   ][   ]

An Array of Pointers to Different Types
   In C language, we can declare arrays of pointers with strings. The concept of arrays of pointers is
   not restricted to characters alone. We can array pointers to various data types, such as ints and
   float structures. The following program demonstrates the Array of Pointers:

   Program
#include<stdio.h>

int main() {
	int a = 343;
	float b = 55.34;
	char c = 'N';
	void *arr[3];

	arr[0] = &a;
	arr[1] = &b;
	arr[2] = &c;

	printf("Integer value: %d\n", *((int *)arr[0]));
	printf("Float value: %f\n", *((float *)arr[1]));
	printf("Char value: %c\n", *((char *)arr[2]));

	return 0;
}


   Output
Integer value: 343
Float value: 55.340000
Char value: N

   Output
Integer value: 343
Float value: 55.340000
Char value: N

Application of Array of Pointers
   In C language, an array of pointers is a powerful tool in programming and has various applications.
   Here are some common applications of Array of Pointers:
     * Dynamic Memory Allocation: Array of Pointer mostly used in the where we used dynamic memory
       allocation. Instead of creating a fixed array size. We can create a dynamic memory allocation for
       each element using pointers. This allows for flexible memory management.

     * Function Pointers: A function pointer variable stores the address of the function. An array of
       function pointers can be used to implement function tables or callback mechanisms, which are
       commonly used in event-driven programming.

     * Multidimensional Arrays: Arrays of pointers are also used for creating multidimensional arrays
       where each  'row' is a dynamically allocated array of a different size.

     * Strings: In C programming, each character is stored in an array of characters, often referred to
       as a character array or C-String. An Array of Pointers can be used to store multiple strings,
       where each pointer points to the first character of each string. An array of Pointer allows
       memory efficiency, especially when dealing with large datasets.

Disadvantages of Array of Pointers
   An Array of Pointers also has some disadvantages. Here, we are discussing some disadvantages of an
   Array of Pointers:
     * Higher Memory Consumption: An array of pointers consumes more memory because it offers dynamic
       storage adventures. The pointers themselves consume memory. For example, on a 64-bit system,
       every pointer will typically consume 8 bytes of memory.

     * Complexity: An array of pointers increases the complexity of the code. It makes, It more
       challenging to read and understand, especially for those new to the concept of pointers.

     * Less Readability: Arrays of the pointer may be less readable in c language code. Indirection
       through pointers can make it harder to understand the code's logic and flow especially for
       developers. That is not familiar with an array of pointers.

Conclusion
   In this article, we learned about Arrays of Pointers. Arrays are collections of variables of the same
   type that can be accessed by indexing. Pointers are variables that store the memory address of the
   other variables. An Array of Pointers is valuable for storing multiple addresses.  With a proper
   understanding of the Array of Pointers, the Developer can harness the full potential of arrays of
   pointers to build an efficient and robust C program.

   FAQs
   What is an array of pointers in C language?
   In the C language, an array of pointers is an array where each element is a pointer to a memory
   location. An array of pointers allows for dynamic memory allocations, flexible data
   structures, and efficient management of heterogeneous data types.

   How do you declare an array of pointers in C language?
   In C, we can declare an array of pointers by specifying the base type of the pointers followed by
   square brackets, which contain the array's size. For example, "int *array[5];" declares an array of
   5-pointers to integers.

   How do you access elements of an array of pointers in C language?
   In C language, we can access elements of an array of pointers using array subscript notation. For
   example, "*ptrArray[i]" accesses the value stored at the memory locations pointed to by the ith
   element of 'ptrArray'.

   Can arrays of pointers in C be used to create multidimensional arrays?
   Yes, we can create multidimensional arrays where each "row" is a dynamically allocated array of
   different sizes. This allows for flexibility in handling irregular or jagged data structures.
