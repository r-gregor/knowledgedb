Pointers

   Pointers are used everywhere in C, so if you want to use the C language fully you have to
   have a very good understanding of pointers. They have to become comfortable for you. The
   goal of this section and the next several that follow is to help you build a complete
   understanding of pointers and how C uses them. For most people it takes a little time and
   some practice to become fully comfortable with pointers, but once you master them you are a
   full-fledged C programmer.

   C uses pointers in three different ways:
     * C uses pointers to create dynamic data structures -- data structures built up from
       blocks of memory allocated from the heap at run-time.
     * C uses pointers to handle variable parameters passed to functions.
     * Pointers in C provide an alternative way to access information stored in arrays.
       Pointer techniques are especially valuable when you work with strings. There is an
       intimate link between arrays and pointers in C.

   In some cases, C programmers also use pointers because they make the code slightly more
   efficient. What you will find is that, once you are completely comfortable with pointers,
   you tend to use them all the time.

   We will start this discussion with a basic introduction to pointers and the concepts
   surrounding pointers, and then move on to the three techniques described above. Especially
   on this article, you will want to read things twice. The first time through you can learn
   all the concepts. The second time through you can work on binding the concepts together
   into an integrated whole in your mind. After you make your way through the material the
   second time, it will make a lot of sense.

Pointers: Why?

   Imagine that you would like to create a text editor -- a program that lets you edit normal
   ASCII text files, like "vi" on UNIX or "Notepad" on Windows. A text editor is a fairly
   common thing for someone to create because, if you think about it, a text editor is
   probably a programmer's most commonly used piece of software. The text editor is a
   programmer's intimate link to the computer -- it is where you enter all of your thoughts
   and then manipulate them. Obviously, with anything you use that often and work with that
   closely, you want it to be just right. Therefore many programmers create their own editors
   and customize them to suit their individual working styles and preferences.

   So one day you sit down to begin working on your editor. After thinking about the features
   you want, you begin to think about the "data structure" for your editor. That is, you begin
   thinking about how you will store the document you are editing in memory so that you can
   manipulate it in your program. What you need is a way to store the information you are
   entering in a form that can be manipulated quickly and easily. You believe that one way to
   do that is to organize the data on the basis of lines of characters. Given what we have
   discussed so far, the only thing you have at your disposal at this point is an array. You
   think, "Well, a typical line is 80 characters long, and a typical file is no more than
   1,000 lines long." You therefore declare a two-dimensional array, like this:

char doc[1000][80];

   This declaration requests an array of 1,000 80-character lines. This array has a total size
   of 80,000 characters.

   As you think about your editor and its data structure some more, however, you might realize
   three things:
     * Some documents are long lists. Every line is short, but there are thousands of lines.
     * Some special-purpose text files have very long lines. For example, a certain data file
       might have lines containing 542 characters, with each character representing the amino
       acid pairs in segments of DNA.
     * In most modern editors, you can open multiple files at one time.

   Let's say you set a maximum of 10 open files at once, a maximum line length of 1,000
   characters and a maximum file size of 50,000 lines. Your declaration now looks like this:
char doc[50000][1000][10];

   That doesn't seem like an unreasonable thing, until you pull out your calculator, multiply
   50,000 by 1,000 by 10 and realize the array contains 500 million characters! Most computers
   today are going to have a problem with an array that size. They simply do not have the
   RAM, or even the virtual memory space, to support an array that large. If users
   were to try to run three or four copies of this program simultaneously on even the largest
   multi-user system, it would put a severe strain on the facilities.

   Even if the computer would accept a request for such a large array, you can see that it is
   an extravagant waste of space. It seems strange to declare a 500 million character array
   when, in the vast majority of cases, you will run this editor to look at 100 line files
   that consume at most 4,000 or 5,000 bytes. The problem with an array is the fact that you
   have to declare it to have its maximum size in every dimension from the beginning. Those
   maximum sizes often multiply together to form very large numbers. Also, if you happen to
   need to be able to edit an odd file with a 2,000 character line in it, you are out of luck.
   There is really no way for you to predict and handle the maximum line length of a text
   file, because, technically, that number is infinite.

   Pointers are designed to solve this problem. With pointers, you can create dynamic data
   structures. Instead of declaring your worst-case memory consumption up-front in an array,
   you instead allocate memory from the heap while the program is running. That way you can
   use the exact amount of memory a document needs, with no waste. In addition, when you close
   a document you can return the memory to the heap so that other parts of the program can use
   it. With pointers, memory can be recycled while the program is running.

   By the way, if you read the previous discussion and one of the big questions you have is,
   "What IS a byte, really?," then the article How Bits and Bytes Work will help you
   understand the concepts, as well as things like "mega," "giga" and "tera." Go take a look
   and then come back.

Pointer Basics

   In this drawing the three variables i, j and p have been declared, but none of the three
   has been initialized. " In this drawing the three variables i, j and p have been declared,
   but none of the three has been initialized. " In this drawing the three variables i, j and
   p have been declared, but none of the three has been initialized.

   To understand pointers, it helps to compare them to normal variables.

   A "normal variable" is a location in memory that can hold a value. For example, when you
   declare a variable i as an integer, four bytes of memory are set aside for it. In your
   program, you refer to that location in memory by the name i. At the machine level that
   location has a memory address. The four bytes at that address are known to you, the
   programmer, as i, and the four bytes can hold one integer value.

   A pointer is different. A pointer is a variable that points to another variable. This means
   that a pointer holds the memory address of another variable. Put another way, the pointer
   does not hold a value in the traditional sense; instead, it holds the address of another
   variable. A pointer "points to" that other variable by holding a copy of its address.

   Because a pointer holds an address rather than a value, it has two parts. The pointer
   itself holds the address. That address points to a value. There is the pointer and the
   value pointed to. This fact can be a little confusing until you get comfortable with it,
   but once you get comfortable it becomes extremely powerful.

   The following example code shows a typical pointer:
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
	int i,j;
	int *p;   /* a pointer to an integer */
	p = &i;
	*p=5;
	j=i;
	printf("%d %d %d\n", i, j, *p);
	return 0;
}


   The first declaration in this program declares two normal integer variables named i and j.
   The line int *p declares a pointer named p. This line asks the compiler to declare a
   variable p that is a pointer to an integer. The * indicates that a pointer is being
   declared rather than a normal variable. You can create a pointer to anything: a float, a
   structure, a char, and so on. Just use a * to indicate that you want a pointer rather than
   a normal variable.

   The line p = &i; will definitely be new to you. In C, & is called the address operator. The
   expression &i means, "The memory address of the variable i." Thus, the expression p = &i;
   means, "Assign to p the address of i." Once you execute this statement, p "points to" i.
   Before you do so, p contains a random, unknown address, and its use will likely cause a
   segmentation fault or similar program crash.

   One good way to visualize what is happening is to draw a picture. After i, j and p are
   declared, the world looks like the image above.

   In this drawing the three variables i, j and p have been declared, but none of the three
   has been initialized. The two integer variables are therefore drawn as boxes containing
   question marks -- they could contain any value at this point in the program's execution.
   The pointer is drawn as a circle to distinguish it from a normal variable that holds a
   value, and the random arrows indicate that it can be pointing anywhere at this moment.

   After the line p = &I;, p is initialized and it points to i, like this:
   " "

   Once p points to i, the memory location i has two names. It is still known as i, but now it
   is known as *p as well. This is how C talks about the two parts of a pointer variable: p is
   the location holding the address, while *p is the location pointed to by that address.
   Therefore *p=5 means that the location pointed to by p should be set to 5, like this:
   " "

   Because the location *p is also i, i also takes on the value 5. Consequently, j=i; sets j
   to 5, and the printf statement produces 5 5 5.

   The main feature of a pointer is its two-part nature. The pointer itself holds an address.
   The pointer also points to a value of a specific type - the value at the address the point
   holds. The pointer itself, in this case, is p. The value pointed to is *p.

Pointers: Understanding Memory Addresses

   The variable f consumes four bytes of RAM in memory. That location has a specific address,
   in this case 248,440. " The variable f consumes four bytes of RAM in memory. That location
   has a specific address, in this case 248,440. " The variable f consumes four bytes of RAM
   in memory. That location has a specific address, in this case 248,440.

   The previous discussion becomes a little clearer if you understand how memory addresses
   work in a computer's hardware. If you have not read it already, now would be a good time to
   read How Bits and Bytes Work to fully understand bits, bytes and words.

   All computers have memory, also known as RAM (random access memory). For example, your
   computer might have 16 or 32 or 64 megabytes of RAM installed right now. RAM holds the
   programs that your computer is currently running along with the data they are currently
   manipulating (their variables and data structures). Memory can be thought of simply as an
   array of bytes. In this array, every memory location has its own address -- the address of
   the first byte is 0, followed by 1, 2, 3, and so on. Memory addresses act just like the
   indexes of a normal array. The computer can access any address in memory at any time (hence
   the name "random access memory"). It can also group bytes together as it needs to to form
   larger variables, arrays, and structures. For example, a floating point variable consumes 4
   contiguous bytes in memory. You might make the following global declaration in a program:

float f;

   This statement says, "Declare a location named f that can hold one floating point value."
   When the program runs, the computer reserves space for the variable f somewhere in memory.
   That location has a fixed address in the memory space, like this:

   While you think of the variable f, the computer thinks of a specific address in memory (for
   example, 248,440). Therefore, when you create a statement like this:
f = 3.14;

   The compiler might translate that into, "Load the value 3.14 into memory location 248,440."
   The computer is always thinking of memory in terms of addresses and values at those
   addresses.

   There are, by the way, several interesting side effects to the way your computer treats
   memory. For example, say that you include the following code in one of your programs:
int i, s[4], t[4], u=0;

for (i=0; i<=4; i++) {
	s[i] = i;
	t[i] =i;
}
printf("s:t\n");

for (i=0; i<=4; i++)
	printf("%d:%d\n", s[i], t[i]);
printf("u = %d\n", u);

   The output that you see from the program will probably look like this:
s:t
1:5
2:2
3:3
4:4
5:5
u = 5

   Why are t[0] and u incorrect? If you look carefully at the code, you can see that the for
   loops are writing one element past the end of each array. In memory, the arrays are placed
   adjacent to one another, as shown here:
   Arrays placed adjacent to one another " Arrays placed adjacent to one another " Arrays
   placed adjacent to one another

   Therefore, when you try to write to s[4], which does not exist, the system writes into t[0]
   instead because t[0] is where s[4] ought to be. When you write into t[4], you are really
   writing into u. As far as the computer is concerned, s[4] is simply an address, and it can
   write into it. As you can see however, even though the computer executes the program, it is
   not correct or valid. The program corrupts the array t in the process of running. If you
   execute the following statement, more severe consequences result:
s[1000000] = 5;

   The location s[1000000] is more than likely outside of your program's memory space. In
   other words, you are writing into memory that your program does not own. On a system with
   protected memory spaces (UNIX, Windows 98/NT), this sort of statement will cause the system
   to terminate execution of the program. On other systems (Windows 3.1, the Mac), however,
   the system is not aware of what you are doing. You end up damaging the code or variables in
   another application. The effect of the violation can range from nothing at all to a
   complete system crash. In memory, i, s, t and u are all placed next to one another at
   specific addresses. Therefore, if you write past the boundaries of a variable, the computer
   will do what you say but it will end up corrupting another memory location.

   Because C and C++ do not perform any sort of range checking when you access an element of
   an array, it is essential that you, as a programmer, pay careful attention to array ranges
   yourself and keep within the array's appropriate boundaries. Unintentionally reading or
   writing outside of array boundaries always leads to faulty program behavior.

   As another example, try the following:
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
	int i,j;
	int *p;   /* a pointer to an integer */
	printf("%d %d\n", p, &i);
	p = &i;
	printf("%d %d\n", p, &i);
	return 0;
}


   This code tells the compiler to print out the address held in p, along with the address of
   i. The variable p starts off with some crazy value or with 0. The address of i is generally
   a large value. For example, when I ran this code, I received the following output:
0    2147478276
2147478276     2147478276

   which means that the address of i is 2147478276. Once the statement p = &i; has been
   executed, p contains the address of i. Try this as well:
#include <stdio.h>

void main() {
	int *p;   /* a pointer to an integer */

	printf("%d\n",*p);
}

   This code tells the compiler to print the value that p points to. However, p has not been
   initialized yet; it contains the address 0 or some random address. In most cases, a
   segmentation fault (or some other run-time error) results, which means that you have used a
   pointer that points to an invalid area of memory. Almost always, an uninitialized pointer
   or a bad pointer address is the cause of segmentation faults.

   Having said all of this, we can now look at pointers in a whole new light. Take this
   program, for example:
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
	int i;
	int *p;   /* a pointer to an integer */
	p = &i;
	*p=5;
	printf("%d %d\n", i, *p);
	return 0;
}

   Here is what's happening:
   " "

   The variable i consumes 4 bytes of memory. The pointer p also consumes 4 bytes (on most
   machines in use today, a pointer consumes 4 bytes of memory. Memory addresses are 32-bits
   long on most CPUs today, although there is a increasing trend toward 64-bit
   addressing). The location of i has a specific address, in this case 248,440. The pointer p
   holds that address once you say p = &i;. The variables *p and i are therefore equivalent.

   The pointer p literally holds the address of i. When you say something like this in a
   program:
printf("%d", p);

   what comes out is the actual address of the variable i.

Pointers: Pointing to the Same Address

   Here is a cool aspect of C: Any number of pointers can point to the same address. For
   example, you could declare p, q, and r as integer pointers and set all of them to point to
   i, as shown here:
int i;
int *p, *q, *r;

p = &i;
q = &i;
r = p;

   Note that in this code, r points to the same thing that p points to, which is i. You can
   assign pointers to one another, and the address is copied from the right-hand side to the
   left-hand side during the assignment. After executing the above code, this is how things
   would look:

   The variable i now has four names: i, *p, *q and *r. There is no limit on the number of
   pointers that can hold (and therefore point to) the same address.

Pointers: Common Bugs

   Bug #1 - Uninitialized pointers
   One of the easiest ways to create a pointer bug is to try to reference the value of a
   pointer even though the pointer is uninitialized and does not yet point to a valid address.
   For example:

	int *p;

	*p = 12;


   The pointer p is uninitialized and points to a random location in memory when you declare
   it. It could be pointing into the system stack, or the global variables, or into the
   program's code space, or into the operating system. When you say *p=12;, the program will
   simply try to write a 12 to whatever random location p points to. The program may explode
   immediately, or may wait half an hour and then explode, or it may subtly corrupt data in
   another part of your program and you may never realize it. This can make this error very
   hard to track down. Make sure you initialize all pointers to a valid address before
   dereferencing them.

   Bug #2 - Invalid Pointer References
   An invalid pointer reference occurs when a pointer's value is referenced even though the
   pointer doesn't point to a valid block.

   One way to create this error is to say p=q;, when q is uninitialized. The pointer p will
   then become uninitialized as well, and any reference to *p is an invalid pointer reference.

   The only way to avoid this bug is to draw pictures of each step of the program and make
   sure that all pointers point somewhere. Invalid pointer references cause a program to crash
   inexplicably for the same reasons given in Bug #1.

   Bug #3 - Zero Pointer Reference
   A zero pointer reference occurs whenever a pointer pointing to zero is used in a statement
   that attempts to reference a block. For example, if p is a pointer to an integer, the
   following code is invalid:
p = 0;
*p = 12;

   There is no block pointed to by p. Therefore, trying to read or write anything from or to
   that block is an invalid zero pointer reference. There are good, valid reasons to point a
   pointer to zero, as we will see in later articles. Dereferencing such a pointer, however,
   is invalid.

   All of these bugs are fatal to a program that contains them. You must watch your code so
   that these bugs do not occur. The best way to do that is to draw pictures of the code's
   execution step by step.

Using Pointers for Function Parameters

   Most C programmers first use pointers to implement something called variable parameters in
   functions. You have actually been using variable parameters in the scanf function -- that's
   why you've had to use the & (the address operator) on variables used with scanf. Now that
   you understand pointers you can see what has really been going on.

   To understand how variable parameters work, lets see how we might go about implementing a
   swap function in C. To implement a swap function, what you would like to do is pass in two
   variables and have the function swap their values. Here's one attempt at an implementation
   -- enter and execute the following code and see what happens:

#include <stdio.h>

void swap(int i, int j) {
	int t;

	t=i;
	i=j;
	j=t;
}

void main() {
	int a,b;

	a=5;
	b=10;
	printf("%d %d\n", a, b);
	swap(a,b);
	printf("%d %d\n", a, b);
}

   When you execute this program, you will find that no swapping takes place. The values of a
   and b are passed to swap, and the swap function does swap them, but when the function
   returns nothing happens.

   To make this function work correctly you can use pointers, as shown below:
#include <stdio.h>

void swap(int *i, int *j) {
	int t;
	t = *i;
	*i = *j;
	*j = t;
}

void main() {
	int a,b;
	a=5;
	b=10;
	printf("%d %d\n",a,b);
	swap(&a,&b);
	printf("%d %d\n",a,b);
}

   To get an idea of what this code does, print it out, draw the two integers a and b, and
   enter 5 and 10 in them. Now draw the two pointers i and j, along with the integer t. When
   swap is called, it is passed the addresses of a and b. Thus, i points to a (draw an arrow
   from i to a) and j points to b (draw another arrow from b to j). Once the pointers are
   initialized by the function call, *i is another name for a, and *j is another name for b.
   Now run the code in swap. When the code uses *i and *j, it really means a and b. When the
   function completes, a and b have been swapped.

   Suppose you accidentally forget the & when the swap function is called, and that the swap
   line accidentally looks like this: swap(a, b);. This causes a segmentation fault. When you
   leave out the &, the value of a is passed instead of its address. Therefore, i points to an
   invalid location in memory and the system crashes when *i is used.

   This is also why scanf crashes if you forget the & on variables passed to it. The scanf
   function is using pointers to put the value it reads back into the variable you have
   passed. Without the &, scanf is passed a bad address and crashes.

   Variable parameters are one of the most common uses of pointers in C. Now you understand
   what's happening!

Dynamic Data Structures

   Dynamic data structures are data structures that grow and shrink as you need them to by
   allocating and deallocating memory from a place called the heap. They are extremely
   important in C because they allow the programmer to exactly control memory consumption.

   Dynamic data structures allocate blocks of memory from the heap as required, and link those
   blocks together into some kind of data structure using pointers. When the data structure no
   longer needs a block of memory, it will return the block to the heap for reuse. This
   recycling makes very efficient use of memory.

   To understand dynamic data structures completely, we need to start with the heap.


---
https://computer.howstuffworks.com/c28.htm

Dynamic Data Structures: The Heap

   The operating system and several applications, along with their global variables and stack
   spaces, all consume portions of memory. When a program completes execution, it releases its
   memory for reuse by other programs. Note that part of the memory space remains unused at
   any given time. " The operating system and several applications, along with their global
   variables and stack spaces, all consume portions of memory. When a program completes
   execution, it releases its memory for reuse by other programs. Note that part of the memory
   space remains unused at any given time. " The operating system and several applications,
   along with their global variables and stack spaces, all consume portions of memory. When a
   program completes execution, it releases its memory for reuse by other programs. Note that
   part of the memory space remains unused at any given time.

   A typical personal computer or workstation today has somewhere between 16 and 64
   megabytes of RAM installed. Using a technique called virtual memory, the system can
   swap pieces of memory on and off the machine's hard disk to create an illusion for the CPU
   that it has much more memory, for example 200 to 500 megabytes. While this illusion is
   complete as far as the CPU is concerned, it can sometimes slow things down tremendously
   from the user's perspective. Despite this drawback, virtual memory is an extremely useful
   technique for "increasing" the amount of RAM in a machine in an inexpensive way. Let's
   assume for the sake of this discussion that a typical computer has a total memory space of,
   for example, 50 megabytes (regardless of whether that memory is implemented in real RAM or
   in virtual memory).

   The operating system on the machine is in charge of the 50-megabyte memory space. The
   operating system uses the space in several different ways, as shown here.

   This is, of course, an idealization, but the basic principles are correct. As you can see,
   memory holds the executable code for the different applications currently running on the
   machine, along with the executable code for the operating system itself. Each application
   has certain global variables associated with it. These variables also consume memory.
   Finally, each application uses an area of memory called the stack, which holds all local
   variables and parameters used by any function. The stack also remembers the order in which
   functions are called so that function returns occur correctly. Each time a function is
   called, its local variables and parameters are "pushed onto" the stack. When the function
   returns, these locals and parameters are "popped." Because of this, the size of a program's
   stack fluctuates constantly as the program is running, but it has some maximum size.

   As a program finishes execution, the operating system unloads it, its globals and its stack
   space from memory. A new program can make use of that space at a later time. In this way,
   the memory in a computer system is constantly "recycled" and reused by programs as they
   execute and complete.

   In general, perhaps 50 percent of the computer's total memory space might be unused at any
   given moment. The operating system owns and manages the unused memory, and it is
   collectively known as the heap. The heap is extremely important because it is available for
   use by applications during execution using the C functions malloc (memory allocate) and
   free. The heap allows programs to allocate memory exactly when they need it during the
   execution of a program, rather than pre-allocating it with a specifically-sized array
   declaration.

Dynamic Data Structures: Malloc and Free

   The block on the right is the block of memory malloc allocated. " The block on the right is
   the block of memory malloc allocated. " The block on the right is the block of memory
   malloc allocated.

   Let's say that you would like to allocate a certain amount of memory during the execution
   of your application. You can call the malloc function at any time, and it will request a
   block of memory from the heap. The operating system will reserve a block of memory for your
   program, and you can use it in any way you like. When you are done with the block, you
   return it to the operating system for recycling by calling the free function. Then other
   applications can reserve it later for their own use.

   For example, the following code demonstrates the simplest possible use of the heap:

int main() {
	int *p;

	p = (int *)malloc(sizeof(int));
	if (p == 0) {
		printf("ERROR: Out of memory\n");
		return 1;
	}

	*p = 5;
	printf("%d\n", *p);
	free(p);
	return 0;
}


   The first line in this program calls the malloc function. This function does three things:
	1. The malloc statement first looks at the amount of memory available on the heap and
	   asks, "Is there enough memory available to allocate a block of memory of the size
	   requested?" The amount of memory needed for the block is known from the parameter
	   passed into malloc -- in this case, sizeof(int) is 4 bytes. If there is not enough
	   memory available, the malloc function returns the address zero to indicate the error
	   (another name for zero is NULL and you will see it used throughout C code). Otherwise
	   malloc proceeds.
	2. If memory is available on the heap, the system "allocates" or "reserves" a block from
	   the heap of the size specified. The system reserves the block of memory so that it
	   isn't accidentally used by more than one malloc statement.
	3. The system then places into the pointer variable (p, in this case) the address of the
	   reserved block. The pointer variable itself contains an address. The allocated block is
	   able to hold a value of the type specified, and the pointer points to it.

   The program next checks the pointer p to make sure that the allocation request succeeded
   with the line if (p == 0) (which could have also been written as if (p == NULL) or even if
   (!p). If the allocation fails (if p is zero), the program terminates. If the allocation is
   successful, the program then initializes the block to the value 5, prints out the value,
   and calls the free function to return the memory to the heap before the program terminates.

   There is really no difference between this code and previous code that sets p equal to the
   address of an existing integer i. The only distinction is that, in the case of the variable
   i, the memory existed as part of the program's pre-allocated memory space and had the two
   names: i and *p. In the case of memory allocated from the heap, the block has the single
   name *p and is allocated during the program's execution. Two common questions:
	 * Is it really important to check that the pointer is zero after each allocation? Yes.
	   Since the heap varies in size constantly depending on which programs are running, how
	   much memory they have allocated, etc., there is never any guarantee that a call to
	   malloc will succeed. You should check the pointer after any call to malloc to make sure
	   the pointer is valid.
	 * What happens if I forget to delete a block of memory before the program terminates?
	   When a program terminates, the operating system "cleans up after it," releasing its
	   executable code space, stack, global memory space and any heap allocations for
	   recycling. Therefore, there are no long-term consequences to leaving allocations
	   pending at program termination. However, it is considered bad form, and "memory leaks"
	   during the execution of a program are harmful, as discussed below.

   The following two programs show two different valid uses of pointers, and try to
   distinguish between the use of a pointer and of the pointer's value:
void main() {
	int *p, *q;

	p = (int *)malloc(sizeof(int));
	q = p;
	*p = 10;
	printf("%d\n", *q);
	*q = 20;
	printf("%d\n", *q);
}

   The final output of this code would be 10 from line 4 and 20 from line 6.

   The following code is slightly different:
void main() {
	int *p, *q;

	p = (int *)malloc(sizeof(int));
	q = (int *)malloc(sizeof(int));
	*p = 10;
	*q = 20;
	*p = *q;
	printf("%d\n", *p);
}

   The final output of this code would be 10 from line 4 and 20 from line 6. " The final
   output of this code would be 10 from line 4 and 20 from line 6. " The final output of this
   code would be 10 from line 4 and 20 from line 6.

   The final output from this code would be 20 from line 6.
   The final output from this code would be 20 from line 6. " The final output from this code
   would be 20 from line 6. " The final output from this code would be 20 from line 6.

   Notice that the compiler will allow *p = *q, because *p and *q are both integers. This
   statement says, "Move the integer value pointed to by q into the integer value pointed to
   by p." The statement moves the values. The compiler will also allow p = q, because p and q
   are both pointers, and both point to the same type (if s is a pointer to a character, p = s
   is not allowed because they point to different types). The statement p = q says, "Point p
   to the same block q points to." In other words, the address pointed to by q is moved into
   p, so they both point to the same block. This statement moves the addresses.

   From all of these examples, you can see that there are four different ways to initialize a
   pointer. When a pointer is declared, as in int *p, it starts out in the program in an
   uninitialized state. It may point anywhere, and therefore to dereference it is an error.
   Initialization of a pointer variable involves pointing it to a known location in memory.
	1. One way, as seen already, is to use the malloc statement. This statement allocates a
	   block of memory from the heap and then points the pointer at the block. This
	   initializes the pointer, because it now points to a known location. The pointer is
	   initialized because it has been filled with a valid address -- the address of the new
	   block.
	2. The second way, as seen just a moment ago, is to use a statement such as p = q so that
	   p points to the same place as q. If q is pointing at a valid block, then p is
	   initialized. The pointer p is loaded with the valid address that q contains. However,
	   if q is uninitialized or invalid, p will pick up the same useless address.
	3. The third way is to point the pointer to a known address, such as a global variable's
	   address. For example, if i is an integer and p is a pointer to an integer, then the
	   statement p=&i initializes p by pointing it to i.
	4. The fourth way to initialize the pointer is to use the value zero. Zero is a special
	   values used with pointers, as shown here: p = 0; or: p = NULL; What this does
	   physically is to place a zero into p. The pointer p's address is zero. This is normally
	   diagrammed as:

   Any pointer can be set to point to zero. When p points to zero, however, it does not point
   to a block. The pointer simply contains the address zero, and this value is useful as a
   tag. You can use it in statements such as:
if (p == 0){        ...}

   or:
while (p != 0){           ...}

   The system also recognizes the zero value, and will generate error messages if you happen
   to dereference a zero pointer. For example, in the following code:
p = 0;*p = 5;

   The program will normally crash. The pointer p does not point to a block, it points to
   zero, so a value cannot be assigned to *p. The zero pointer will be used as a flag when we
   get to linked lists.

   The malloc command is used to allocate a block of memory. It is also possible to deallocate
   a block of memory when it is no longer needed. When a block is deallocated, it can be
   reused by a subsequent malloc command, which allows the system to recycle memory. The
   command used to deallocate memory is called free, and it accepts a pointer as its
   parameter. The free command does two things:
	1. The block of memory pointed to by the pointer is unreserved and given back to the free
	   memory on the heap. It can then be reused by later new statements.
	2. The pointer is left in an uninitialized state, and must be reinitialized before it can
	   be used again.

   The free statement simply returns a pointer to its original uninitialized state and makes
   the block available again on the heap.

   The following example shows how to use the heap. It allocates an integer block, fills it,
   writes it, and disposes of it:
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
	int *p;
	p = (int *)malloc (sizeof(int));
	*p=10;
	printf("%d\n",*p);
	free(p);
	return 0;
}

   This code is really useful only for demonstrating the process of allocating, deallocating,
   and using a block in C. The malloc line allocates a block of memory of the size specified
   -- in this case, sizeof(int) bytes (4 bytes). The sizeof command in C returns the size, in
   bytes, of any type. The code could just as easily have said malloc(4), since sizeof(int)
   equals 4 bytes on most machines. Using sizeof, however, makes the code much more portable
   and readable.

   The malloc function returns a pointer to the allocated block. This pointer is generic.
   Using the pointer without typecasting generally produces a type warning from the compiler.
   The (int *) typecast converts the generic pointer returned by malloc into a "pointer to an
   integer," which is what p expects. The free statement in C returns a block to the heap for
   reuse.

   The second example illustrates the same functions as the previous example, but it uses a
   structure instead of an integer. In C, the code looks like this:
#include <stdio.h>

struct rec {
	int i;
	float f;
	char c;
};

int main() {
	struct rec *p;
	p=(struct rec *) malloc (sizeof(struct rec));
	(*p).i=10;
	(*p).f=3.14;
	(*p).c='a';
	printf("%d %f %c\n",(*p).i,(*p).f,(*p).c);
	free(p);
	return 0;
}

   Note the following line:
(*p).i=10;

   Many wonder why the following doesn't work:
*p.i=10;

   The answer has to do with the precedence of operators in C. The result of the calculation
   5+3*4 is 17, not 32, because the * operator has higher precedence than + in most computer
   languages. In C, the . operator has higher precedence than *, so parentheses force the
   proper precedence.

   Most people tire of typing (*p).i all the time, so C provides a shorthand notation. The
   following two statements are exactly equivalent, but the second is easier to type:
(*p).i=10;
p->i=10;

   You will see the second more often than the first when reading other people's code.

Advanced Pointers

   You will normally use pointers in somewhat more complicated ways than those shown in some
   of the previous examples. For example, it is much easier to create a normal integer and
   work with it than it is to create and use a pointer to an integer. In this section, some of
   the more common and advanced ways of working with pointers will be explored.

Pointer Types
   It is possible, legal, and beneficial to create pointer types in C, as shown below:

typedef int *IntPointer;
...
IntPointer p;

   This is the same as saying:
int *p;

   This technique will be used in many of the examples on the following pages. The technique
   often makes a data declaration easier to read and understand, and also makes it easier to
   include pointers inside of structures or pass pointer parameters in functions.

https://computer.howstuffworks.com/c31.htm

Pointers to Structures

   It is possible to create a pointer to almost any type in C, including user-defined types.
   It is extremely common to create pointers to structures. An example is shown below:
   " "
typedef struct {
	char name[21];
	char city[21];
	char state[3];
} Rec;
typedef Rec *RecPointer;

RecPointer r;
r = (RecPointer)malloc(sizeof(Rec));

   The pointer r is a pointer to a structure. Please note the fact that r is a pointer, and
   therefore takes four bytes of memory just like any other pointer. However, the malloc
   statement allocates 45 bytes of memory from the heap. *r is a structure just like any other
   structure of type Rec. The following code shows typical uses of the pointer variable:

strcpy((*r).name, "Leigh");
strcpy((*r).city, "Raleigh");
strcpy((*r).state, "NC");
printf("%s\n", (*r).city);
free(r);

   You deal with *r just like a normal structure variable, but you have to be careful with the
   precedence of operators in C. If you were to leave off the parenthesis around *r the code
   would not compile because the "." operator has a higher precedence than the "*" operator.
   Because it gets tedious to type so many parentheses when working with pointers to
   structures, C includes a shorthand notation that does exactly the same thing:
strcpy(r->name, "Leigh");

   The r-> notation is exactly equivalent to (*r)., but takes two fewer characters.
   " "

Pointers to Arrays
   It is also possible to create pointers to arrays, as shown below:
	int *p;
	int i;

	p = (int *)malloc(sizeof(int[10]));
	for (i=0; i<10; i++)
		p[i] = 0;
	free(p);

   or:
	int *p;
	int i;

	p = (int *)malloc(sizeof(int[10]));
	for (i=0; i<10; i++)
		*(p+i) = 0;
	free(p);

   Note that when you create a pointer to an integer array, you simply create a normal pointer
   to int. The call to malloc allocates an array of whatever size you desire, and the pointer
   points to that array's first element. You can either index through the array pointed to by
   p using normal array indexing, or you can do it using pointer arithmetic. C sees both forms
   as equivalent.

   This particular technique is extremely useful when working with strings. It lets you
   allocate enough storage to exactly hold a string of a particular size.

Arrays of Pointers
   Sometimes a great deal of space can be saved, or certain memory-intensive problems can be
   solved, by declaring an array of pointers. In the example code below, an array of 10
   pointers to structures is declared, instead of declaring an array of structures. If an
   array of the structures had been created instead, 243 * 10 = 2,430 bytes would have been
   required for the array. Using the array of pointers allows the array to take up minimal
   space until the actual records are allocated with malloc statements. The code below simply
   allocates one record, places a value in it, and disposes of the record to demonstrate the
   process:
typedef struct {
	char s1[81];
	char s2[81];
	char s3[81];
} Rec;
Rec *a[10];

a[0] = (Rec *)malloc(sizeof(Rec));
strcpy(a[0]->s1, "hello");
free(a[0]);


Structures Containing Pointers
   Structures can contain pointers, as shown below:
typedef struct {
	char name[21];
	char city[21];
	char phone[21];
	char *comment;
} Addr;

Addr s;
char comm[100];

gets(s.name, 20);
gets(s.city, 20);
gets(s.phone, 20);
gets(comm, 100);
s.comment =  (char *)malloc(sizeof(char[strlen(comm)+1]));
strcpy(s.comment, comm);

   This technique is useful when only some records actually contained a comment in the comment
   field. If there is no comment for the record, then the comment field would consist only of
   a pointer (4 bytes). Those records having a comment then allocate exactly enough space to
   hold the comment string, based on the length of the string typed by the user.

Pointers to Pointers

   It is possible and often useful to create pointers to pointers. This technique is sometimes
   called a handle, and is useful in certain situations where the operating system wants to be
   able to move blocks of memory on the heap around at its discretion. The following example
   demonstrates a pointer to a pointer:
int **p;
int *q;

p = (int **)malloc(sizeof(int *));
*p = (int *)malloc(sizeof(int));
**p = 12;
q = *p;
printf("%d\n", *q);
free(q);
free(p);

   Windows and the Mac OS use this structure to allow memory compaction on the heap. The
   program manages the pointer p, while the operating system manages the pointer *p. Because
   the OS manages *p, the block pointed to by *p (**p) can be moved, and *p can be changed to
   reflect the move without affecting the program using p. Pointers to pointers are also
   frequently used in C to handle pointer parameters in functions.

Pointers to Structures Containing Pointers
   It is also possible to create pointers to structures that contain pointers. The following
   example uses the Addr record from the previous section:
typedef struct {
	char name[21];
	char city[21];
	char phone[21];
	char *comment;
} Addr;
Addr *s;
char comm[100];

s = (Addr *)malloc(sizeof(Addr));
gets(s->name, 20);
gets(s->city, 20);
gets( s->phone, 20);
gets(comm, 100);
s->comment = (char *)malloc(sizeof(char[strlen(comm)+1]));
strcpy(s->comment, comm);

   The pointer s points to a structure that contains a pointer that points to a string.

   In this example, it is very easy to create lost blocks if you aren't careful. For example,
   here is a different version of the AP example.
s = (Addr *)malloc(sizeof(Addr));
gets(comm, 100);
s->comment = (char *)malloc(sizeof(char[strlen(comm)+1]));
strcpy(s->comment, comm);
free(s);

   This code creates a lost block because the structure containing the pointer pointing to the
   string is disposed of before the string block is disposed of, as shown here.

Linking
   Finally, it is possible to create structures that are able to point to identical
   structures, and this capability can be used to link together a whole string of identical
   records in a structure called a linked list.
typedef struct {
	char name[21];
	char city[21];
	char state[21];
	Addr *next;
} Addr;
Addr *first;

   The compiler will let you do this, and it can be used with a little experience to create
   structures like the one shown to the left.

A Linked Stack Example

   A good example of dynamic data structures is a simple stack library, one that uses a
   dynamic list and includes functions to init, clear, push, and pop. The library's header
   file looks like this:
/* Stack Library - This library offers the
   minimal stack operations for a
   stack of integers (easily changeable) */

typedef int stack_data;

extern void stack_init();
/* Initializes this library.
   Call first before calling anything. */

extern void stack_clear();
/* Clears the stack of all entries. */

extern int stack_empty();
/* Returns 1 if the stack is empty, 0 otherwise. */

extern void stack_push(stack_data d);
/* Pushes the value d onto the stack. */

extern stack_data stack_pop();
/* Returns the top element of the stack,
   and removes that element.
   Returns garbage if the stack is empty. */

   The library's code file follows:

#include "stack.h"
#include <stdio.h>

/* Stack Library - This library offers the
   minimal stack operations for a stack of integers */

struct stack_rec {
	stack_data data;
	struct stack_rec *next;
};

struct stack_rec *top=NULL;

void stack_init()
/* Initializes this library.
   Call before calling anything else. */
{
	top=NULL;
}

void stack_clear()
/* Clears the stack of all entries. */
{
	stack_data x;

	while (!stack_empty())
	x=stack_pop();
}

int stack_empty()
/* Returns 1 if the stack is empty, 0 otherwise. */
{
	if (top==NULL)
		return(1);
	else
		return(0);
}

void stack_push(stack_data d)
/* Pushes the value d onto the stack. */
{
	struct stack_rec *temp;
	temp = (struct stack_rec *)malloc(sizeof(struct stack_rec));
	temp->data=d;
	temp->next=top;
	top=temp;
}

stack_data stack_pop()
/* Returns the top element of the stack,
   and removes that element.
   Returns garbage if the stack is empty. */
{
	struct stack_rec *temp;
	stack_data d=0;
	if (top!=NULL) {
		d=top->data;
		temp=top;
		top=top->next;
		free(temp);
	}
	return(d);
}

   Note how this library practices information hiding: Someone who can see only the header
   file cannot tell if the stack is implemented with arrays, pointers, files, or in some other
   way. Note also that C uses NULL. NULL is defined in stdio.h, so you will almost always have
   to include stdio.h when you use pointers. NULL is the same as zero.

C Errors to Avoid
	 * Forgetting to include parentheses when you reference a record, as in (*p).i above
	 * Failing to dispose of any block you allocate - For example, you should not say top=NULL
	   in the stack function, because that action orphans blocks that need to be disposed.
	 * Forgetting to include stdio.h with any pointer operations so that you have access to
	   NULL.

Other Things to Try
   Add a dup, a count, and an add function to the stack library to duplicate the top element
   of the stack, return a count of the number of elements in the stack, and add the top two
   elements in the stack.
   Try This!

	 * Build a driver program and a makefile, and compile the stack library with the driver to
	   make sure it works.

Using Pointers with Arrays

   Arrays and pointers are intimately linked in C. To use arrays effectively, you have to know
   how to use pointers with them. Fully understanding the relationship between the two
   probably requires several days of study and experimentation, but it is well worth the
   effort.

   Let's start with a simple example of arrays in C:

   Advertisement
#define MAX 10

int main() {
	int a[MAX];
	int b[MAX];
	int i;
	for(i=0; i<MAX; i++)
		a[i]=i;
	b=a;
	return 0;
}

   Enter this code and try to compile it. You will find that C will not compile it. If you
   want to copy a into b, you have to enter something like the following instead:
for (i=0; i<MAX; i++)
	b[i]=a[i];


   Or, to put it more succinctly:
for (i=0; i<MAX; b[i]=a[i], i++);

   Better yet, use the memcpy utility in string.h.

   Arrays in C are unusual in that variables a and b are not, technically, arrays themselves.
   Instead they are permanent pointers to arrays. a and b permanently point to the first
   elements of their respective arrays -- they hold the addresses of a[0] and b[0]
   respectively. Since they are permanent pointers you cannot change their addresses. The
   statement a=b; therefore does not work.

   Because a and b are pointers, you can do several interesting things with pointers and
   arrays. For example, the following code works:
#define MAX 10

void main() {
	int a[MAX];
	int i;
	int *p;

	p=a;
	for(i=0; i<MAX; i++)
		a[i]=i;
	printf("%d\n",*p);
}


   The state of the variables right before the for loop starts executing. " The state of the
   variables right before the for loop starts executing. " The state of the variables right
   before the for loop starts executing.

   The statement p=a; works because a is a pointer. Technically, a points to the address of
   the 0th element of the actual array. This element is an integer, so a is a pointer to a
   single integer. Therefore, declaring p as a pointer to an integer and setting it equal to a
   works. Another way to say exactly the same thing would be to replace p=a; with p=&a[0];.
   Since a contains the address of a[0], a and &a[0] mean the same thing.

   Now that p is pointing at the 0th element of a, you can do some rather strange things with
   it. The a variable is a permanent pointer and can not be changed, but p is not subject to
   such restrictions. C actually encourages you to move it around using pointer arithmetic .
   For example, if you say p++;, the compiler knows that p points to an integer, so this
   statement increments p the appropriate number of bytes to move it to the next element of
   the array. If p were pointing to an array of 100-byte-long structures, p++; would move p
   over by 100 bytes. C takes care of the details of element size.

   You can copy the array a into b using pointers as well. The following code can replace (for
   i=0; i<MAX; a[i]=b[i], i++); :
p=a;
q=b;
for (i=0; i<MAX; i++) {
	*q = *p;
	q++;
	p++;
}


   You can abbreviate this code as follows:
p=a;
q=b;
for (i=0; i<MAX; i++)
	*q++ = *p++;

   And you can further abbreviate it to:
for (p=a,q=b,i=0; i<MAX; *q++ = *p++, i++);

   What if you go beyond the end of the array a or b with the pointers p or q? C does not care
   -- it blithely goes along incrementing p and q, copying away over other variables with
   abandon. You need to be careful when indexing into arrays in C, because C assumes that you
   know what you are doing.

   You can pass an array such as a or b to a function in two different ways. Imagine a
   function dump that accepts an array of integers as a parameter and prints the contents of
   the array to stdout. There are two ways to code dump:
void dump(int a[],int nia) {
	int i;
	 for (i=0; i<nia; i++)
		printf("%d\n",a[i]);
}

   or:
void dump(int *p,int nia) {
	int i;
	 for (i=0; i<nia; i++)
		printf("%d\n",*p++);
}

   The nia (number_in_array) variable is required so that the size of the array is known. Note
   that only a pointer to the array, rather than the contents of the array, is passed to the
   function. Also note that C functions can accept variable-size arrays as parameters.

Strings

   Strings in C are intertwined with pointers to a large extent. You must become familiar with
   the pointer concepts covered in the previous articles to use C strings effectively. Once
   you get used to them, however, you can often perform string manipulations very efficiently.

   A string in C is simply an array of characters. The following line declares an array that
   can hold a string of up to 99 characters.

char str[100];

   It holds characters as you would expect: str[0] is the first character of the string,
   str[1] is the second character, and so on. But why is a 100-element array unable to hold up
   to 100 characters? Because C uses null-terminated strings, which means that the end of any
   string is marked by the ASCII value 0 (the null character), which is also represented in C
   as '\0'.

   Null termination is very different from the way many other languages handle strings. For
   example, in Pascal, each string consists of an array of characters, with a length byte that
   keeps count of the number of characters stored in the array. This structure gives Pascal a
   definite advantage when you ask for the length of a string. Pascal can simply return the
   length byte, whereas C has to count the characters until it finds '\0'. This fact makes C
   much slower than Pascal in certain cases, but in others it makes it faster, as we will see
   in the examples below.

   Because C provides no explicit support for strings in the language itself, all of the
   string-handling functions are implemented in libraries. The string I/0 operations (gets,
   puts, and so on) are implemented in <stdio.h>, and a set of fairly simple string
   manipulation functions are implemented in <string.h> (on some systems, <strings.h> ).

   The fact that strings are not native to C forces you to create some fairly roundabout code.
   For example, suppose you want to assign one string to another string; that is, you want to
   copy the contents of one string to another. In C, as we saw in the last article, you cannot
   simply assign one array to another. You have to copy it element by element. The string
   library (<string.h> or <strings.h> ) contains a function called strcpy for this task. Here
   is an extremely common piece of code to find in a normal C program:
char s[100];
strcpy(s, "hello");

   After these two lines execute, the following diagram shows the contents of s:

   The top diagram shows the array with its characters. The bottom diagram shows the
   equivalent ASCII code values for the characters, and is how C actually thinks about the
   string (as an array of bytes containing integer values). See How Bits and Bytes Work
   for a discussion of ASCII codes.

   The following code shows how to use strcpy in C:
#include <string.h>
int main() {
	char s1[100],s2[100];
	strcpy(s1,"hello");   /* copy "hello" into s1 */
	strcpy(s2,s1);        /* copy s1 into s2 */
	return 0;
}

   strcpy is used whenever a string is initialized in C. You use the strcmp function in the
   string library to compare two strings. It returns an integer that indicates the result of
   the comparison. Zero means the two strings are equal, a negative value means that s1 is
   less than s2, and a positive value means s1 is greater than s2.
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
int main() {
	char s1[100],s2[100];
	 gets(s1);
	gets(s2);
	if (strcmp(s1,s2)==0)
		printf("equal\n");
	else if (strcmp(s1,s2)<0)
		printf("s1 less than s2\n");
	else
		printf("s1 greater than s2\n");
	return 0;
}

   Other common functions in the string library include strlen, which returns the length of a
   string, and strcat which concatenates two strings. The string library contains a number of
   other functions, which you can peruse by reading the man page.

   To get you started building string functions, and to help you understand other programmers'
   code (everyone seems to have his or her own set of string functions for special purposes in
   a program), we will look at two examples, strlen and strcpy. Following is a strictly
   Pascal-like version of strlen:
int strlen(char s[]) {
	int x;
	x=0;
	while (s[x] != '\0')
		 x=x+1;
	return(x);
}

   Most C programmers shun this approach because it seems inefficient. Instead, they often use
   a pointer-based approach:
int strlen(char *s) {
	int x=0;
	while (*s != '\0') {
		x++;
		s++;
	}
	return(x);
}


   You can abbreviate this code to the following:
int strlen(char *s) {
	int x=0;
	while (*s++)
		x++;
	return(x);
}

   I imagine a true C expert could make this code even shorter.

   When I compile these three pieces of code on a MicroVAX with gcc, using no optimization,
   and run each 20,000 times on a 120-character string, the first piece of code yields a time
   of 12.3 seconds, the second 12.3 seconds, and the third 12.9 seconds. What does this mean?
   To me, it means that you should write the code in whatever way is easiest for you to
   understand. Pointers generally yield faster code, but the strlen code above shows that that
   is not always the case.

   We can go through the same evolution with strcpy:
strcpy(char s1[],char s2[]) {
	int x;
	for (x=0; x<=strlen(s2); x++)
		s1[x]=s2[x];
}

   Note here that <= is important in the for loop because the code then copies the '\0'. Be
   sure to copy '\0'. Major bugs occur later on if you leave it out, because the string has no
   end and therefore an unknown length. Note also that this code is very inefficient, because
   strlen gets called every time through the for loop. To solve this problem, you could use
   the following code:
strcpy(char s1[],char s2[]) {
	int x,len;
	 len=strlen(s2);
	for (x=0; x<=len; x++)
		s1[x]=s2[x];
}


   The pointer version is similar.
strcpy(char *s1,char *s2) {
	while (*s2 != '\0') {
		*s1 = *s2;
		s1++;
		s2++;
	}
}


   You can compress this code further:
strcpy(char *s1,char *s2) {
	while (*s2)
		*s1++ = *s2++;
}

   If you wish, you can even say while (*s1++ = *s2++);. The first version of strcpy takes 415
   seconds to copy a 120-character string 10,000 times, the second version takes 14.5 seconds,
   the third version 9.8 seconds, and the fourth 10.3 seconds. As you can see, pointers
   provide a significant performance boost here.

   The prototype for the strcpy function in the string library indicates that it is designed
   to return a pointer to a string:
char *strcpy(char *s1,char *s2)

   Most of the string functions return a string pointer as a result, and strcpy returns the
   value of s1 as its result.

   Using pointers with strings can sometimes result in definite improvements in speed and you
   can take advantage of these if you think about them a little. For example, suppose you want
   to remove the leading blanks from a string. You might be inclined to shift characters over
   on top of the blanks to remove them. In C, you can avoid the movement altogether:
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main() {
	char s[100],*p;
	gets(s);
	p=s;
	while (*p==' ')
		p++;
	printf("%s\n",p);
	return 0;
}

   This is much faster than the movement technique, especially for long strings.

   You will pick up many other tricks with strings as you go along and read other code.
   Practice is the key.

Special Note on Strings

Special Note on String Constants

   Suppose you create the following two code fragments and run them:
Fragment 1
{
	char *s;

	s="hello";
	printf("%s\n",s);
}

Fragment 2
{
	char s[100];

	strcpy(s,"hello");
	printf("%s\n",s);
}

   These two fragments produce the same output, but their internal behavior is quite
   different. In fragment 2, you cannot say s="hello";. To understand the differences, you
   have to understand how the string constant table works in C.

   When your program is compiled, the compiler forms the object code file, which contains your
   machine code and a table of all the string constants declared in the program. In fragment
   1, the statement s="hello"; causes s to point to the address of the string hello in the
   string constant table. Since this string is in the string constant table, and therefore
   technically a part of the executable code, you cannot modify it. You can only point to it
   and use it in a read-only manner.

   In fragment 2, the string hello also exists in the constant table, so you can copy it into
   the array of characters named s. Since s is not a pointer, the statement s="hello"; will
   not work in fragment 2. It will not even compile.

   Special Note on Using Strings with malloc

   Suppose you write the following program:
int main() {
	char *s;

	s=(char *) malloc (100);
	s="hello";
	free(s);
	return 0;
}

   It compiles properly, but gives a segmentation fault at the free line when you run it. The
   malloc line allocates a block 100 bytes long and points s at it, but now the s="hello";
   line is a problem. It is syntactically correct because s is a pointer; however, when
   s="hello"; is executed, s points to the string in the string constant table and the
   allocated block is orphaned. Since s is pointing into the string constant table, the string
   cannot be changed; free fails because it cannot deallocate a block in an executable region.

   The correct code follows:
int main() {
	char *s;
	s=(char *) malloc (100);
	strcpy(s,"hello");
	free(s);
	return 0;
}

   Try This!
	 * Create a program that reads in a string containing a first name followed by a blank
	   followed by a last name. Write functions to remove any leading or trailing blanks.
	   Write another function that returns the last name.
	 * Write a function that converts a string to uppercase.
	 * Write a function that gets the first word from a string and returns the remainder of
	   the string.

   C Errors to Avoid
   Losing the \0 character, which is easy if you aren't careful, can lead to some very subtle
   bugs. Make sure you copy \0 when you copy strings. If you create a new string, make sure
   you put \0 in it. And if you copy one string to another, make sure the receiving string is
   big enough to hold the source string, including \0. Finally, if you point a character
   pointer to some characters, make sure they end with \0.
