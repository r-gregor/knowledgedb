C program to swap two numbers using macro
July 20, 2025

   Write a C program to swap two numbers using macro. How swap two numbers without using third variable
   using macro in C program. Logic to swap two number without using third variable using macro.

   Swapping values of two variables is a common problem. We already discussed several ways to swap two
   variables throughout the course of C programming tutorial.

   In this post we will continue our macro exercise. Here I will explain how you can transform swapping
   logic to macro.

How to swap two numbers using macro
   Before moving ahead, I assume that you are aware with
   [https://codeforwin.org/2018/12/c-program-to-define-undefine-redefine-macro.html]macro syntax, how to
   define and use.

   For this post I will swap two numbers without using third variable. I will make use of bitwise
   operator. If you have any related to bitwise operator logic please read
   [https://codeforwin.org/2016/01/c-program-to-swap-two-numbers-using-bitwise-operator.html]how to swap two
   numbers using bitwise operator.

   Let us get started and define a macro that accepts two arguments say SWAP(x, y). The macro will swap
   the values of x and y.

   Example:
#define SWAP(x, y) (x ^= y ^= x)

Program to swap two numbers using macro

/**
 * C program to swap two numbers using macro
 */

#include <stdio.h>

// Define macro to swap two numbers
#define SWAP(x, y) (x ^= y ^= x ^= y)

int main() {
	int num1, num2;

	// Input two numbers from users
	printf("Enter any two number to swap: ");
	scanf("%d%d", &num1, &num2);

	printf("Values before swapping\n");
	printf("num1 = %d, num2 = %d\n\n", num1, num2);

	SWAP(num1, num2);

	printf("Values after swapping\n");
	printf("num1 = %d, num2 = %d\n", num1, num2);

	return 0;
}

   Output
Enter any two number to swap: 10 20
Values before swapping
num1 = 10, num2 = 20

Values after swapping
num1 = 20, num2 = 10
