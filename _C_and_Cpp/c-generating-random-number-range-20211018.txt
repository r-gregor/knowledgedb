Generating random number in a range in C
23 Apr, 2018

How to generate a random number in a given range in C.

   Examples:
   We provide nothing but the best curated videos and practice problems for our students. Check out the
   C Foundation Course and master the C language from basic to advanced level. Wait no more, start

Input : Lower = 50,
		Upper = 100,
		Count of random Number = 5

Output : 91 34 21 88 29

Explanation: lower is the lower limit of the
range and upper is the upper limit of the range.
Output contains 5 random numbers in given range.

   As C does not have an inbuilt function for generating a number in the range, but it does have
   rand function which generate a random number from 0 to RAND_MAX. With the help of rand () a
   number in range can be generated as num = (rand() % (upper â€“ lower + 1)) + lower

// C program for generating a
// random number in a given range.
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <time.h>

// Generates and prints 'count' random
// numbers in range [lower, upper].
void printRandoms(int lower, int upper, int count) {
	int i;
	for (i = 0; i < count; i++) {
	int num = (rand() % (upper - lower + 1)) + lower;
	printf("%d ", num);
	}
}

// Driver code
int main() {
	int lower = 5, upper = 7, count = 1;

	// Use current time as
	// seed for random generator
	srand(time(0));

	printRandoms(lower, upper, count);

	return 0;
}

   Output:
7

   Note : Output generated on each run may be different because number is generated randomly.
