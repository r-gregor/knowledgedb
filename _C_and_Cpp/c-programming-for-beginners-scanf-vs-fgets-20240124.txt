C Programming for Beginners : scanf() vs fgets()
Oct 30, 2021

Let's Print our Full Name
   To print our full name, the program will take input as a string array and print it.

   Note : Before we scan and store a string into a string array variable, we should declare the maximum
   size for that string array variable which is 20 in this case : char name[20]

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {

	printf("Enter your name : ");
	char name[20];
	scanf("%s", &name);

	printf("Hii %s\n", name);

	return 0
}

   Output :
Enter your name : Jagdish Narayan Samal
Hii Jagdish

   Wait! What happened to the middle name and the last name ?
   This behavior is shown because scanf() doesn't accept whitespace.
   While accepting the sequence of input, it gets terminated where the first whitespace character is,
   with a null character.

What is the solution ?
   Well, instead of scanf() we will use fgets().

The fgets() function

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {

	printf("Enter your name : ");
	char name[20];
	fgets(name, 20, stdin); // stdin means standard output
	                        //make sure to match the array size which is 20

	printf("Hii %s\n", name);

	printf("Did fgets() work?");

	return 0
}
   Output :
Enter your name : Tatshat Sarangi
Hii Tatshat SarangiDid fgets() work ?

   Okay, so it worked!
   Wait! wait! wait! Did you notice the blank the after Hii Tatshat Sarangi ?
   Reason : The fgets() adds a new line character at the end of the string on it's own.
   So now we need to replace the \n with \0 .

Correct Way to Print Full Name
   Note : For now, you don't have to understand how the \n got replaced by \0.
   You will understand this in the following lessons.
   Make sure to include the string.h

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {

	printf("Enter your name : ");
	char name[20];
	fgets(name, 20, stdin); // stdin means standard output
	                        //make sure to match the array size which is 20
	
	// removing the new line added by fgets()
	name[strlen(name) - 1] = '\0';

	printf("Hii %s\n", name);

	printf("Did fgets() work?");

	return 0
}
   Output :
Enter your name : Steve Harrington
Hii Steve Harrington
Did fgets() work ?

   Oh yes! It did work.
   So this is how you can print a string array with whitespaces.
