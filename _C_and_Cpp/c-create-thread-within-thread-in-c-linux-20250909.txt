Can I create a thread/threads within a thread in C Linux POSIX programming? If so, how?

***
Yes, you can create threads within a thread in C using POSIX threading (pthreads) on a Linux system. This
is commonly referred to as "nested threading." Each thread can create additional threads, allowing for
a hierarchical structure of threads.

Here's a simple example demonstrating how to create threads within a thread using the pthreads library:

Example Code

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <pthread.h>
#include <unistd.h>

#define NUM_THREADS 2
#define NUM_SUB_THREADS 2

void *sub_thread_function(void *arg) {
	int thread_id = *((int *)arg);
	printf("Sub-thread %d is running\n", thread_id);
	sleep(1); // Simulate some work
	printf("Sub-thread %d is exiting\n", thread_id);
	return NULL;
}

void *main_thread_function(void *arg) {
	int thread_id = *((int *)arg);
	printf("Main thread %d is creating sub-threads\n", thread_id);

	pthread_t sub_threads[NUM_SUB_THREADS];
	int sub_thread_ids[NUM_SUB_THREADS];

	for (int i = 0; i < NUM_SUB_THREADS; i++) {
		sub_thread_ids[i] = i + 1; // Assign an ID for the sub-thread
		pthread_create(&sub_threads[i], NULL, sub_thread_function, &sub_thread_ids[i]);
	}

	// Wait for all sub-threads to finish
	for (int i = 0; i < NUM_SUB_THREADS; i++) {
		pthread_join(sub_threads[i], NULL);
	}

	printf("Main thread %d is exiting\n", thread_id);
	return NULL;
}

int main() {
	pthread_t main_threads[NUM_THREADS];
	int thread_ids[NUM_THREADS];

	for (int i = 0; i < NUM_THREADS; i++) {
		thread_ids[i] = i + 1; // Assign an ID for the main thread
		pthread_create(&main_threads[i], NULL, main_thread_function, &thread_ids[i]);
	}

	// Wait for all main threads to finish
	for (int i = 0; i < NUM_THREADS; i++) {
		pthread_join(main_threads[i], NULL);
	}

	printf("All threads have finished execution\n");
	return 0;
}

Explanation of the Code
    Includes and Definitions: The necessary headers are included, and constants for the number of threads
    are defined.

    Sub-thread Function: sub_thread_function is defined, which will be executed by the sub-threads. It
    prints a message, simulates some work with sleep, and then exits.

    Main Thread Function: main_thread_function is defined, which creates two sub-threads. It waits for
    all sub-threads to finish before exiting.

    Main Function: In the main function, two main threads are created. It waits for all main threads to
    finish before printing a final message.

Compilation and Execution
To compile and run the program, use the following commands:

$> gcc -pthread -o nested_threads nested_threads.c
./nested_threads

Important Notes
    Thread Safety: Ensure that any shared resources are protected to avoid data races, typically using
    mutexes or other synchronization mechanisms.

    Resource Management: Be mindful of the system's limits on the number of threads. Creating too many
    threads can lead to resource exhaustion.

    Stack Size: Each thread has its own stack, which can be configured using pthread_attr_setstacksize
    if needed.

This example provides a basic framework for creating nested threads in a POSIX compliant manner. You
can expand upon this by adding more complexity as needed for your application.
