Array of Structures vs Array within a Structure in C
15 Jul, 2025

   Both Array of Structures and Array within a Structure in C programming is a combination of arrays and
   structures but both are used to serve different purposes.

Array within a Structure
   A structure is a data type in C that allows a group of related variables to be treated as a single
   unit instead of separate entities. A structure may contain elements of different data types - int,
   char, float, double, etc. It may also contain an array as its member. Such an [33]array is called an
   array within a structure. An array within a structure is a member of the structure and can be
   accessed just as we access other elements of the structure.

   Below is a demonstration of a program that uses the concept of the array within a structure. The
   program displays the record of a student comprising the roll number, grade, and marks secured in
   various subjects. The marks in various subjects have been stored under an array called marks. The
   whole record is stored under a structure called a candidate.

Example

   The below program demonstrates the use of an array within a structure.
// C program to demonstrate the
// use of an array within a structure
#include <stdio.h>

// Declaration of the structure candidate
struct candidate {
	int roll_no;
	char grade;

	// Array within the structure
	float marks[4];
};

// Function to displays the content of
// the structure variables
void display(struct candidate a1) {

	printf("Roll number : %d\n", a1.roll_no);
	printf("Grade : %c\n", a1.grade);
	printf("Marks secured:\n");
	int i;
	int len = sizeof(a1.marks) / sizeof(float);

	// Accessing the contents of the
	// array within the structure
	for (i = 0; i < len; i++) {
		printf("Subject %d : %.2f\n", i + 1, a1.marks[i]);
	}
}

// Driver Code
int main() {
	// Initialize a structure
	struct candidate A = { 1, 'A', { 98.5, 77, 89, 78.5 } };

	// Function to display structure
	display(A);
	return 0;
}

   Output
Roll number : 1
Grade : A
Marks secured:
Subject 1 : 98.50
Subject 2 : 77.00
Subject 3 : 89.00
Subject 4 : 78.50

Array of Structures
   An array is a collection of data items of the same type. Each element of the array can be int, char,
   float, double, or even a structure. We have seen that a structure allows elements of different data
   types to be grouped together under a single name. This structure can then be thought of as a new data
   type in itself. So, an array can comprise elements of this new data type. An array of structures
   finds its applications in grouping the records together and provides for fast access.

   Below is a demonstration of an array of structures. The array holds the details of the students in a
   class. The details include the roll number, grade, and marks, which have been grouped under a
   structure (record). There exists one record for each student. This is how a collection of related
   variables can be assembled under a single entity to enhance the clarity of code and increase its
   efficiency.

Example
   The below program demonstrates the usage of an array of structures.

// C program to demonstrate the
// usage of an array of structures
#include <stdio.h>

// Declaring a structure class
struct class {
	int roll_no;
	char grade;
	float marks;
};

// Function to displays the contents
// of the array of structures
void display(struct class class_record[3]) {
	int i, len = 3;

	// Display the contents of the array
	// of structures here, each element
	// of the array is a structure of class
	for (i = 0; i < len; i++) {
		printf("Roll number : %d\n",
				class_record[i].roll_no);
		printf("Grade : %c\n", class_record[i].grade);
		printf("Average marks : %.2f\n",
				class_record[i].marks);
		printf("\n");
	}
}

// Driver Code
int main() {
	// Initialize of an array of structures
	struct class class_record[3] = { { 1, 'A', 89.5f },
		{ 2, 'C', 67.5f },
		{ 3, 'B', 70.5f } };

	// Function Call to display
	// the class_record
	display(class_record);
	return 0;
}

   Output
Roll number : 1
Grade : A
Average marks : 89.50

Roll number : 2
Grade : C
Average marks : 67.50

Roll number : 3
Grade : B
Average marks : 70.50

Difference between Array of Structures and Array within Structures
   Below is the tabular difference between the Array within a Structure and Array of Structures:
