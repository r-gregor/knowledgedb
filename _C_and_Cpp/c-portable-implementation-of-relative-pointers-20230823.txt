Portable C Implementation of Relative Pointers

   I define relative pointer to mean what Ginger Bill describes as Self-Relative Pointers:

     ... define the base [to which an offset will be applied] to be the memory address of the offset
     itself

   For example, consider this struct:

struct house {
	int32_t weight;
}

struct person {
	int32_t age;
	struct house *residence;
}

int32_t getPersonsHousesWeight(struct person *p) {
	return p->residence->weight;
}

   The relative-pointer implementation of the same thing in C that I think might work is:

struct house { ... } // same as before
struct person {
	int32_t age;
	int64_t residence; // an offset from the person's address in memory
}

int32_t getPersonsHousesWeight(struct person *p) {
	return ((struct residence *)((char *)p + (p->residence)))->weight;
}

   Assuming that alignment of everything is good (all 8 bytes), is this free of undefined behavior?

***
   @tstanisl has provided an excellent answer (which I've accepted) that thoroughly explains UB in the
   context of stack allocations. I am curious how allocation into a large slab of contiguous heap would
   impact this analysis. For example:

int foo(void) {
	char *base = mmap(NULL,4096,PROT_WRITE | PROT_READ,-1,MAP_PRIVATE | MAP_ANONYMOUS);

	// Omitting mmap error checking
	struct person *myPerson = (struct person *)(base + 128);
	struct house *myHouse = (struct house *)(base + 256);
	int32_t delta = (char *)myHouse - (char *)myPerson;

	// Does the computation of delta invoke UB?
}

***
     * For me, it depends on how you define the offset, if you set it at runtime like:
       p->residence = (intptr_t)p - (intptr_t)h (assuming person *p, house *h) then it would work well.
***
     * it depends if the p and struct house object belong the same large object like struct
       person_in_da_house { struct person p; struct house h; }. Moreover, there are some technical
       condition on how the pointer p is constructed.
***
   Usually it is going to be UB. The first case is when person and house belong to separate object. In
   such a case it will be UB because the pointer arithmetics is performed outside of the object.

int foo(void) {
	struct person p;
	struct house h;
	p.residence = (char *)&h - (char *)&p; // already UB
	getPersonsHousesWeight(&p); // UB again
}

   In practice it means that the compiler is not obligated to notice that objects accessed from a
   pointers constructed from &p can alias with object h because p and h are separete memory regions (aka
   objects).

   When both objects are placed inside a larger object then the situation is a bit better. Though it
   still would be technical UB.

int foo(void) {
	struct ph {
		struct person p;
		struct house h;
	} ph;
	ph.p.residence = (char *)&ph.h - (char *)&ph.p; // still UB
	getPersonsHousesWeight(&ph.p); // UB again
}

   It UB because pointer arithmetic is done outside the member object. (char *)&ph.h - 1 is a pointer
   outside of ph.h.

   Note, that this code will likely work pretty much everywhere. Otherwise, heavily used
   container_of-like macros would not work breaking a lot of existing code including the Linux kernel.

   To avoid UB the pointer must be constructed in a special way to avoid moving outside of the
   originating object. Rather using &ph.h one should use (char *)&ph + offsetof(struct ph, h). Similarly
   &ph.p should be replaced with (char *)&ph + offsetof(struct ph, p).

   Now this code should be portable:

int foo(void) {
	struct ph {
		struct person p;
		struct house h;
	} ph;
	struct person *p_ptr = (struct person *)((char *)&ph + offsetof(struct ph, p));
	struct house  *h_ptr = (struct house *) ((char *)&ph + offsetof(struct ph, h));
	ph.p.residence = (char *)h_ptr - (char *)p_ptr;
	getPersonsHousesWeight(p_ptr);
}

Though it is very obscure. The interesting discussion on this topic can be found at

     * Thanks! This is very thorough. I've added an edit at the end of the original question to ask more
       specifically about the case of heap allocation. In the context of heap allocation, it is less
       clear to me what an "originating object" is. Is it the entire block of memory that the OS hands
       the user? Or does slicing into a block somehow change the originating pointer?

***
       @AndrewThaddeusMartin the C standard is agnostic about OS, heaps and stack. To be fully portable
       you should treat each pointer returned from malloc as being placed in a unique address space
       fully separated from everything else. I guess the relative pointers can only be used for object
       created within a region returned from the same call to malloc().

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25296019/can-a-container-of-macro-ever-be-strictly-conforming

Can a "container_of" macro ever be strictly-conforming?

   A commonly-used macro in the linux kernel (and other places) is container_of, which is (basically)
   defined as follows:

#define container_of(ptr, type, member) (((type) *)((char *)(ptr) - offsetof((type), (member))))

   Which basically allows recovery of a "parent" structure given a pointer to one of its members:

struct foo {
	char ch;
	int bar;
};
...
struct foo f = ...
int *ptr = &f.bar; // 'ptr' points to the 'bar' member of 'struct foo' inside 'f'
struct foo *g = container_of(ptr, struct foo, bar);
// now, 'g' should point to 'f', i.e. 'g == &f'

   However, it's not entirely clear whether the subtraction contained within container_of is considered
   undefined behavior.

   On one hand, because bar inside struct foo is only a single integer, then only *ptr should be valid
   (as well as ptr + 1). Thus, the container_of effectively produces an expression like ptr -
   sizeof(int), which is undefined behavior (even without dereferencing).

   On the other hand, §6.3.2.3 p.7 of the C standard states that converting a pointer to a different
   type and back again shall produce the same pointer. Therefore, "moving" a pointer to the middle of a
   struct foo object, then back to the beginning should produce the original pointer.

   The main concern is the fact that implementations are allowed to check for out-of-bounds indexing at
   runtime. My interpretation of this and the aforementioned pointer equivalence requirement is that the
   bounds must be preserved across pointer casts (this includes pointer decay - otherwise, how could you
   use a pointer to iterate across an array?). Ergo, while ptr may only be an int pointer, and neither
   ptr - 1 nor *(ptr + 1) are valid, ptr should still have some notion of being in the middle of a
   structure, so that (char *)ptr - offsetof(struct foo, bar) is valid (even if the pointer is equal to
   ptr - 1 in practice).

   Finally, I came across the fact that if you have something like:
int arr[5][5] = ...
int *p = &arr[0][0] + 5;
int *q = &arr[1][0];

   while it's undefined behavior to dereference p, the pointer by itself is valid, and required to
   compare equal to q (see this question). This means that p and q compare the same, but can be
   different in some implementation-defined manner (such that only q can be dereferenced). This could
   mean that given the following:

// assume same 'struct foo' and 'f' declarations
char *p = (char *)&f.bar;
char *q = (char *)&f + offsetof(struct foo, bar);

   p and q compare the same, but could have different boundaries associated with them, as the casts to
   (char *) come from pointers to incompatible types.

   To sum it all up, the C standard isn't entirely clear about this type of behavior, and attempting to
   apply other parts of the standard (or, at least my interpretations of them) leads to conflicts. So,
   is it possible to define container_of in a strictly-conforming manner? If so, is the above definition
   correct?

***
     * 3
       It seems like it should be OK: Since the original pointer points into the middle of a large
       object, it's OK to convert it to a char pointer and treat it as pointing to an element of the
       object representation of the large object and perform arithmetic on it.
     * 1
       The C spec is completely ambiguous as to the meaning of the term 'the array object' when you have
       arrays of arrays (or structs containing arrays, since the struct objects are implicitly arrays of
       size 1) -- it could mean either the inner array or the containing array. Combine this with the
       fact that the spec requires an implementation to allow treating any object as a sequence of bytes
       (chars) that can be copied around, and you have a situation where it seems like all this sort of
       pointer manipulation has to be allowed, but the spec does not clearly say it.
     * "[...] converting a pointer to a different type and back again shall produce the same pointer"-to
       be precise, a pointer which "shall compare equal to the original pointer". As I read it, this
       does not necessarily imply the "same" regarding bounds information.
     * 1
       The standard also isn't clear about accessing an object through a converted pointer - it only
       mentions the alignment requirement.

***
TLDR

   It is a matter of debate among language lawyers as to whether programs using container_of are
   strictly conforming, but pragmatists using the container_of idiom are in good company and are
   unlikely to run into issues running programs compiled with mainstream tool chains on mainstream
   hardware. In other words:
     * strictly conforming: debated
     * conforming: yes, for all practical purposes, in most situations

What can be said today

    1. There is no language in the standard C17 standard that unambiguously requires support for the
       container_of idiom.
    2. There are defect reports that suggest the standard intends to allow implementations room to
       forbid the container_of idiom by tracking "provenance" (i.e. the valid bounds) of objects along
       with pointers. However, these alone are not normative.
    3. There is recent activity in the C memory object model study group that aims to provide more
       rigor to this and similar questions. See Clarifying the C memory object model - N2012 from
       2016, Pointers are more abstract than you might expect from 2018, and A Provenance-aware
       Memory Object Model for C - N2676 from 2021.

   Depending on when you read this, there may be newer documents available at the WG14 document log.
   Additionally, Peter Sewell collects related reference material here:
   https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pes20/cerberus/. These documents do not change what a strictly
   conforming program is today (in 2021, for versions C17 and older), but they suggest that the answer
   may change in newer versions of the standard.

Background

What is the container_of idiom?
   This code demonstrates the idiom by expanding the contents of the macro usually seen implementing the
   idiom:
#include <stddef.h>

struct foo {
	long first;
	short second;
};

void container_of_idiom(void) {
	struct foo f;

	char *b = (char *)&f.second;        /* Line A */
	b -= offsetof(struct foo, second);  /* Line B */
	struct foo *c = (struct foo *)b;    /* Line C */
}

   In the above case, a container_of macro would typically take a short * argument intended to point to
   the second field of a struct foo. It would also take arguments for struct foo and second, and would
   expand to an expression returning struct foo *. It would employ the logic seen in lines A-C above.

   The question is: is this code strictly conforming?

   First, let's define "strictly conforming"

     C17 4 (5-7) Conformance
    5. A strictly conforming program shall use only those features of the language and library specified
       in this International Standard. It shall not produce output dependent on any unspecified,
       undefined, or implementation-defined behavior, and shall not exceed any minimum implementation
       limit.
    6. [...] A conforming hosted implementation shall accept any strictly conforming program. [...] A
       conforming implementation may have extensions (including additional library functions), provided
       they do not alter the behavior of any strictly conforming program.
    7. A conforming program is one that is acceptable to a conforming implementation.

   (For brevity I omitted the definition of "freestanding" implementations, as it concerns limitations
   on the standard library not relevant here.)

   From this we see that strict conformance is quite strict, but a conforming implementation is allowed
   to define additional behavior as long as it does not alter the behavior of a strictly conforming
   program. In practice, almost all implementations do this; this is the "practical" definition that
   most C programs are written against.

   For the purposes of this answer I'll contain my answer to strictly conforming programs, and talk
   about merely conforming programs at the end.

Defect reports
   The language standard itself is somewhat unclear on the question, but several defect reports shed
   more light on the issue.

***
#include <stdlib.h>

struct A {
	char x[1];
};

int main() {
	struct A *p = (struct A *)malloc(sizeof(struct A) + 100);
	p->x[5] = '?'; /* This is the key line */
	return p->x[5];
}

   The response to the DR includes (emphasis mine):
     Subclause 6.3.2.1 describes limitations on pointer arithmetic, in connection with array
     subscripting. (See also subclause 6.3.6.) Basically, it permits an implementation to tailor how it
     represents pointers to the size of the objects they point at. Thus, the expression p->x[5] may
     fail to designate the expected byte, even though the malloc call ensures that the byte is present.
     The idiom, while common, is not strictly conforming.

   Here we have the first indication that the standard allows implementations to "tailor" pointer
   representations based on the objects pointed at, and that pointer arithmetic that "leaves" the valid
   range of the original object pointed to is not strictly conforming.

#include <stddef.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

typedef double T;
struct hacked {
	int size;
	T data[1];
};

struct hacked *f(void) {
	T *pt;
	struct hacked *a;
	char *pc;

	a = malloc(sizeof(struct hacked) + 20 * sizeof(T));
	if (a == NULL) return NULL;
	a->size = 20;

	/* Method 1 */
	a->data[8] = 42; /* Line A */

	/* Method 2 */
	pt = a->data;
	pt += 8; /* Line B */
	*pt = 42;

	/* Method 3 */
	pc = (char *)a;
	pc += offsetof(struct hacked, data);
	pt = (T *)pc; /* Line C */
	pt += 8;      /* Line D */
	*pt = 6 * 9;
	return a;
}

   Astute readers will notice that /* Method 3 */ above is much like the container_of idiom. I.e. it
   takes a pointer to a struct type, converts it to char *, does some pointer arithmetic that takes the
   char * outside the range of the original struct, and uses the pointer.

   The committee responded by saying /* Line C */ was strictly conforming but /* Line D */ was not
   strictly conforming by the same argument given for DR 51 above. Further, the committee said that the
   answers "are not affected if T has char type."

Verdict: container_of is not strictly conforming (probably)
   The container_of idiom takes a pointer to a struct's subobject, converts the pointer to char *, and
   performs pointer arithmetic that moves the pointer outside the subobject. This is the same set of
   operations discussed in DR 51 and 72 apply. There is clear intent on the part of the committee. They
   hold that the standard "permits an implementation to tailor how it represents pointers to the size of
   the objects they point at" and thus "the idiom, while common, is not strictly conforming."

   One might argue that container_of side steps the issue by doing the pointer arithmetic in the domain
   of char * pointers, but the committee says the answer is "not affected if T has char type."

May the container_of idiom be used in practice?
   No, if you want to be strict and use only code that is not clearly strictly conforming according to
   current language standards.

   Yes, if you are a pragmatist and believe that an idiom widely used in Linux, FreeBSD, Microsoft
   Windows C code is enough to label the idiom conforming in practice.

   As noted above, implementations are allowed to guarantee behavior in ways not required by the
   standard. On a practical note, the container_of idiom is used in the Linux kernel and many other
   projects. It is easy for implementations to support on modern hardware. Various "sanitizer" systems
   such as Address Sanitizer, Undefined Behavior Sanitizer, Purify, Valgrind, etc., all allow this
   behavior. On systems with flat address spaces, and even segmented ones, various "pointer games" are
   common (e.g. converting to integral values and masking off low order bits to find page boundaries,
   etc). These techniques are so common in C code today that it is very unlikely that such idioms will
   cease to function on any commonly supported system now or in the future.

   In fact, I found one implementation of a bounds checker that gives a different interpretation of C
   semantics in its paper. The quotes are from the following paper: Richard W. M. Jones and Paul H. J.
   Kelly. Backwards-compatible bounds checking for arrays and pointers in C programs. In Third
   International Workshop on Automated Debugging (editors M. Kamkarand D. Byers), volume 2 (1997), No.
   009 of Linköping Electronic Articles in Computer and Information Science. Linköping University
   Electronic Press, Linköping, Sweden. ISSN 1401-9841, May 1997 pp. 13-26. URL

     ANSI C conveniently allows us to define an object as the fundamental unit of memory allocation.
     [...] Operations are permitted which manipulate pointers within objects, but pointer operations
     are not permitted to cross between two objects. There is no ordering defined between objects, and
     the programmer should never be allowed to make assumptions about how objects are arranged in
     memory.

     Bounds checking is not blocked or weakened by the use of a cast (i.e. type coercion). Cast can
     properly be used to change the type of the object to which a pointer refers, but cannot be used to
     turn a pointer to one object into a pointer to another. A corollary is that bounds checking is not
     type checking: it does not prevent storage from being declared with one data structure and used
     with another. More subtly, note that for this reason, bounds checking in C cannot easily validate
     use of arrays of structs which contain arrays in turn.

     Every valid pointer-valued expression in C derives its result from exactly one original storage
     object. If the result of the pointer calculation refers to a different object, it is invalid. This
     language is quite definitive but take note the paper was published in 1997, before the DR reports
     above were written and responded to. The best way to interpret the bounds checking system
     described in the paper is as a conforming implementation of C, but not one that detects all
     non-strictly conforming programs. I do see similarities between this paper and A
     Provenance-aware Memory Object Model for C - N2676 from 2021, however, so in the future the ideas
     similar to the ones quoted above might be codified in the language standard.

   The C memory object model study group is a treasure trove of discussions related to container_of
   and many other closely related problems. From their mailing list archive we have these mentions of
   the container_of idiom:

   2.5.4 Q34 Can one move among the members of a struct using representation-pointer arithmetic and
   casts?

     The standard is ambiguous on the interaction between the allowable pointer arithmetic (on unsigned
     char * representation pointers) and subobjects. For example, consider:

     Example cast_struct_inter_member_1.c

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stddef.h>

typedef struct { float f; int i; } st;

int main() {
	st s = {.f=1.0, .i=1};
	int *pi = &(s.i);
	unsigned char *pci = ((unsigned char *)pi);
	unsigned char *pcf = (pci - offsetof(st,i)) + offsetof(st,f);
	float *pf = (float *)pcf;
	*pf = 2.0;  // is this free of undefined behaviour?
	printf("s.f=%f *pf=%f  s.i=%i\n",s.f,*pf,s.i);
}

     This forms an unsigned char * pointer to the second member (i) of a struct, does arithmetic on that
     using offsetof to form an unsigned char * pointer to the first member, casts that into a pointer to
     the type of the first member (f), and uses that to write.

     In practice we believe that this is all supported by most compilers and it is used in practice,
     e.g. as in the Container idiom of Chisnall et al. [ASPLOS 2015], where they discuss container
     macros that take a pointer to a structure member and compute a pointer to the structure as a
     whole. They see it heavily used by one of the example programs they studied. We are told that
     Intel's MPX compiler does not support the container macro idiom, while Linux, FreeBSD, and Windows
     all rely on it.

     The standard says (6.3.2.3p7): "...When a pointer to an object is converted to a pointer to a
     character type, the result points to the lowest addressed byte of the object. Successive
     increments of the result, up to the size of the object, yield pointers to the remaining bytes of
     the object.". This licenses the construction of the unsigned char * pointer pci to the start of the
     representation of s.i (presuming that a structure member is itself an "object", which itself is
     ambiguous in the standard), but allows it to be used only to access the representation of s.i.

     The offsetof definition in stddef.h, 7.19p3, " offsetof(type,member-designator) which expands to
     an integer constant expression that has type size_t, the value of which is the offset in bytes, to
     the structure member (designated by member-designator, from the beginning of its structure
     (designated by type", implies that the calculation of pcf gets the correct numerical address, but
     does not say that it can be used, e.g. to access the representation of s.f. As we saw in the
     discussion of provenance, in a post-DR260 world, the mere fact that a pointer has the correct
     address does not necessarily mean that it can be used to access that memory without giving rise to
     undefined behaviour.

     Finally, if one deems pcf to be a legitimate char * pointer to the representation of s.f, then the
     standard says that it can be converted to a pointer to any object type if sufficiently aligned,
     which for float * it will be. 6.3.2.3p7: "A pointer to an object type may be converted to a pointer
     to a different object type. If the resulting pointer is not correctly aligned (68) for the
     referenced type, the behavior is undefined. Otherwise, when converted back again, the result shall
     compare equal to the original pointer....". But whether that pointer has the right value and is
     usable to access memory is left unclear.

     This example should be allowed in our de facto semantics but is not clearly allowed in the ISO
     text.

     What needs to be changed in the ISO text to clarify this?

     More generally, the ISO text's use of "object" is unclear: does it refer to an allocation, or are
     struct members, union members, and array elements also "objects"?

   Key phrase being "This example should be allowed in our de facto semantics but is not clearly allowed
   in the ISO text." i.e. I take this to mean the the group documenets like N2676 wish to see
   container_of supported.

   However, in a later message:
     2.2 Provenance and subobjects: container-of casts

     A key question is whether one can cast from a pointer to the first member of a struct to the
     struct as a whole, and then use that to access other members. We discussed it previously in N2222
     Q34 Can one move among the members of a struct using representation-pointer arithmetic and casts?,
     N2222 Q37 Are usable pointers to a struct and to its first member interconvertable?, N2013, and
     N2012. Some of us had thought that that was uncontroversially allowed in ISO C, by 6.7.2.1p15 ...A
     pointer to a structure object, suitably converted, points to its initial member..., and vice
     versa..., but others disagree. In practice, this seems to be common in real code, in the
     "container-of" idiom.

     Though someone suggested that the IBM XL C/C++ compiler does not support it. Clarification from
     WG14 and compiler teams would be very helpful on this point.

   With this, the group sums it up nicely: the idiom is widely used, but there is disagreement about
   what the standard says about it.

***
     * A great post. It provides so much useful material about abstraction that pointer really are. As I
       understand the ambiguity comes from insufficient definition of "object". I think that the
       strict-conformance of container_of-like macros may depend on how the pointer are formed.Do you
       think that in example 2.5.4 if int *pi = &(s.i); was replaced with int *pi = (int *)((char *)&s +
       offsetof(st, i)); then the behavior would be defined?
     * Yes I think the distinction you draw holds. The standard says that if you take (char *)&x then you
       can increment/decrement that char * across the bytes of the x object at will. The n2676 paper I
       linked, I think, gives both cases valid semantics. It says that both would point into the same
       "storage instance" and says pointer arithmetic within any one "storage instance" is valid. The
       paper says storage instances can't overlap, which implies that containing objects and sub-objects
       are in the same storage instance. I think this attempts to codify what most would expect
       intuitively.
     * 1
       @nmr, yes I misspelled "provenance" there, thanks.

***
   I think its strictly conforming or there's a big defect in the standard. Referring to your last
   example, the section on pointer arithmetic doesn't give the compiler any leeway to treat p and q
   differently. It isn't conditional on how the pointer value was obtained, only what object it points
   to.

   Any interpretation that p and q could be treated differently in pointer arithmetic would require an
   interpretation that p and q do not point to the same object. Since since there's no implementation
   dependent behaviour in how you obtained p and q then that would mean they don't point to the same
   object on any implementation. That would in turn require that p == q be false on all implementations,
   and so would make all actual implementations non-conforming.

***
   1
     * Yes, what object it points to is key. The debate seems to center around that question. The
       standard merely says "the object" but in the case of char *p = (char *)&f.bar; the object could
       be f or its subobject f.bar. Some argue that the standard allows, but does not require,
       implementations to restrict the providence of the p pointer to the range of bytes in f.bar. If p
       is decremented past the first byte of f.bar, some argue p has undefined value, so equality
       comparison is undefined, and if so your proof by contradiction would not hold.

***
   I just want to answer this bit.
int arr[5][5] = ...
int *p = &arr[0][0] + 5;
int *q = &arr[1][0];

   This is not UB. It is certain that p is a pointer to an element of the array, provided only that it
   is within bounds. In each case it points to the 6th element of a 25 element array, and can safely be
   dereferenced. It can also be incremented or decremented to access other elements of the array.

   See n3797 S8.3.4 for C++. The wording is different for C, but the meaning is the same. In effect
   arrays have a standard layout and are well-behaved with respect to pointers.

   Let us suppose for a moment that this is not so. What are the implications? We know that the layout
   of an array int[5][5] is identical to int[25], there can be no padding, alignment or other extraneous
   information. We also know that once p and q have been formed and given a value, they must be
   identical in every respect.

   The only possibility is that, if the standard says it is UB and the compiler writer implements the
   standard, then a sufficiently vigilant compiler might either (a) issue a diagnostic based on
   analysing the data values or (b) apply an optimisation which was dependent on not straying outside
   the bounds of sub-arrays.

   Somewhat reluctantly I have to admit that (b) is at least a possibility. I am led to the rather
   strange observation that if you can conceal from the compiler your true intentions this code is
   guaranteed to produce defined behaviour, but if you do it out in the open it may not.

     * Did you read the question linked in this question? The memory layout and bounds checking are
       two things, the former being guaranteed and the latter being the question here.
     * Yes, I read it and yes they are. That answer was old, the issue was not properly resolved in
       comments and I don't feel like adding to them. But your comment leads me to a different train of
       thought...see edit.
     * Your (b) is another good point, while the main concern was reliable run-time bounds checking (not
       compile-time checking as you suggest in (a)). Reading the standard quote given in the linked post
       (especially the emphasized part and the footnote) makes me believe the standard's intent is to
       not allow such out-of-bounds access. And yes, this necessarily implies, that pointers comparing
       equal may differ in their associated bounds information and thus arithmetic/dereferencing may
       throw an exception for one of them and succeed for the other. Two examples:
     * 2
       int p[1]; int q; if(p+1 == &q) /* look if they happen to be contiguous in stack */ { p[1] = 1; /*
       Does this initialize q? */ } assuming the if branch is entered. I think it's desirably to allow a
       bounds-checking implementation to catch this nonsense-construct. A less contrived example: struct
       { char str1[16], str2[16]; } foo; fgets(str1, 32, stdin); (Assume no padding, we could have
       statically asserted sizeof foo == 32.) Should this be allowed to throw an exception? We can
       discuss further on this in chat, if you like, I'm really interested in this topic.
     * 1
       @david.pfx there's nothing in the standard that says a pointer to an element of an array can't
       carry information on the originating array. Otherwise, with something like int x[5], p = &x[2], q
       = p[3];, there'd be no way of knowing that p[3] refers to x[5], which is out of bounds.
