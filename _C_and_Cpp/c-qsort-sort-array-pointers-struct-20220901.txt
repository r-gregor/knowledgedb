Use qsort() to sort array of pointers to struct

	 Hey Everyone,
	 I'm fairly new to C and am having trouble sorting a linked list. To do this I decided to put the
	 element pointers in an array and use qsort() to do the actual sorting by referencing the list data
	 in my compare function used by qsort().
	 Here's the relevent bits of code so you can get an idea of what I'm trying to do.
	 Code:
struct data {
	char   name[20];
	int    age;
	int    weight;
};

typedef struct data DATA;

struct linked_list {
	DATA d;
	struct linked_list *next;
};

typedef struct linked_list ELEMENT;
typedef ELEMENT *          LINK;

/* This next function is where I'm having problems. It's my understanding, and perhaps I'm wrong, that
qsort() passes a pointer to element in the given array to the compare function, so in this case it would
be a pointer to a pointer. Below is what I originally tried (*ia->d.age), but this produced a few warnings
about %s in the printf() expecting char* not an int. I then took away the asterisks and it compiled without
warnings but used garbage values, so no luck there either. After that I tried a whole whack of things,
none of which worked. */
int cmpAge(const void *a, const void *b) {
	LINK ia = (LINK)a;
	LINK ib = (LINK)b;

	/* This is a quick/dirty printf() I'm using to help me debug */
	printf("%s & %s (%d - %d) = %d\n", *ia->d.name, *ib->d.name, *ia->d.age, *ib->d.age, (*ia->d.age - *ib->d.age));

	/* If working, compare ages and return value <, =, >, 0 */
	return (*ia->d.age - *ib->d.age);
}


LINK sortByAge(LINK a) {
	int i, size = countem(a)        /* countem = simple function to count members in linked list */
	LINK tmp[size];                 /* create array of type LINK to hold pointers to elements of linked list
*/

	/* Fill LINK array */
	for (i = 0; a != NULL; ++i, a = a->next)
		tmp[i] = a;

	/* sort array by using cmpAge() */
	qsort(tmp, size, sizeof(LINK), cmpAge);

	/* change pointers in linked list to the order resulting from qsort() */
	for (i = 0; i < size; ++i) {
		if (i = (size - 1))
			tmp[i]->next = NULL;
		else
			tmp[i]->next = tmp[i+1];
	}

	/* return head address of list */
	return tmp[0];
}

     It seems to me, I'm obviously not referencing the struct data correctly.
     Does anyone have any suggestions?
     Thanks.

***
     If you have a node pointer:
struct node *ptr;

     Then you use this to get its members:
ptr->member

     Not this:
*ptr->member

     The only reason you'd use that would be if you had a pointer to a pointer to a node. You don't.
     Your compiler should be complaining at you, telling you what lines you have wrong.

***
     I realize that and I've tried taking away the asterisk with no luck. The reason why I put it in
     was because qsort() passes a pointer to another pointer in this case. But you're right, it's
     wrong, but taking it away doesn't work either. Garbage just gets printed, but if I use the array
     directly, before it gets passed to cmpAge(), like tmp[3]->d.age, it works fine so the problem is
     not in the values stored in the array but in the way I'm accessing them within cmpAge().

***
     > LINK ia = (LINK)a;
     These should be
     LINK *ia = (LINK*)a;
     And in the body of the code, use
     (*ia)->member

     If you dance barefoot on the broken glass of undefined behaviour, you've got to expect the
     occasional cut.

***
     That worked.
     I feel really stupid because I'm 95% sure I tried that. When I was testing I was only changing the
     first argument after the control string in the printf() and I got an error, as it did today, until
     my brain decided to return and I realized the errors were coming from the other references. What
     can you do?
