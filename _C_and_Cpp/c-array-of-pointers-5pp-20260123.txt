Array of Pointers in C
23 Jul, 2025

   In C, a pointer array is a homogeneous collection of indexed pointer variables that are references to
   a memory location. It is generally used in C Programming when we want to point at multiple memory
   locations of a similar data type in our C program. We can access the data by dereferencing the
   pointer pointing to it.

   Syntax:
pointer_type *array_name[array_size];

   Here,
     * pointer_type: Type of data the pointer is pointing to.
     * array_name:   Name of the array of pointers.
     * array_size:   Size of the array of pointers.

     Note: It is important to keep in mind the operator precedence and associativity in the array of
     pointers declarations of different type as a single change will mean the whole different thing.
     For example, enclosing *array_name in the parenthesis will mean that array_name is a pointer to an
     array.

   Example:

// C program to demonstrate the use of array of pointers
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
	// declaring some temp variables
	int var1 = 10;
	int var2 = 20;
	int var3 = 30;

	// array of pointers to integers
	int *ptr_arr[3] = { &var1, &var2, &var3 };

	// traversing using loop
	for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
		printf("Value of var%d: %d\tAddress: %p\n", i + 1, *ptr_arr[i], ptr_arr[i]);
	}

	return 0;
}

   Output
Value of var1: 10    Address: 0x7fff1ac82484
Value of var2: 20    Address: 0x7fff1ac82488
Value of var3: 30    Address: 0x7fff1ac8248c

Explanation:

            0x7fff1ac82484  0x7fff1ac82488  0x7fff1ac8248c
                  var1            var1            var1
                 [ 10 ]          [ 20 ]          [ 30 ]
                   ^               ^               ^
                   |               |               |
   ptr_arr [0x7fff1ac82484][0x7fff1ac82488][0x7fff1ac8248c]
              ptr_arr[0]      ptr_arr[1]      ptr_arr[2]

   As shown in the above example, each element of the array is a pointer pointing to an integer. We can
   access the value of these integers by first selecting the array element and then dereferencing it to
   get the value.

Array of Pointers to Character
   One of the main applications of the array of pointers is to store multiple strings as an array of
   pointers to characters. Here, each pointer in the array is a character pointer that points to the
   first character of the string.

   Syntax:
char *array_name[array_size];

   After that, we can assign a string of any length to these pointers.

   Example:

char* arr[5] = { "gfg", "geek", "Geek", "Geeks", "GeeksforGeeks" };

    Pointers
      |
      v
    arr[0]  [2000] --> [g]fg            \
    arr[1]  [2004] --> [g]eek           | Pointers pointing to
    arr[2]  [2008] --> [G]eek           | the first character
    arr[3]  [2012] --> [G]eeks          | of string
    arr[4]  [2016] --> [G]eeksforGeeks  /

     Note: Here, each string will take different amount of space so offset will not be the same and
     does not follow any particular order.

   This method of storing strings has the advantage of the traditional array of strings. Consider the
   following two examples:

   Example 1:

// C Program to print Array of strings without array of pointers
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
	char str[3][10] = { "Geek", "Geeks", "Geekfor" };

	printf("String array Elements are:\n");

	for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
		printf("%s\n", str[i]);
	}

	return 0;
}

   Output
String array Elements are:
Geek
Geeks
Geekfor

   In the above program, we have declared the 3 rows and 10 columns of our array of strings. But because
   of predefining the size of the array of strings the space consumption of the program increases if the
   memory is not utilized properly or left unused. Now let's try to store the same strings in an array
   of pointers.

   Example 2:

// C Program to print Array of strings with array of pointers
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
	// Declare an array of pointers to characters
	char *arr[] = { "geek", "Geeks", "Geeksfor" };

	// Print each string and its address
	for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
		printf("%s\n", arr[i]);
	}

	// Print addresses of each string
	for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
		printf("Address of arr[%d]: %p\n", i, (void *)arr[i]);
	}

	return 0;
}

   Output
geek
Geeks
Geeksfor
Address of arr[0]: 0x400634
Address of arr[1]: 0x400639
Address of arr[2]: 0x40063f

   Here, the total memory used is the memory required for storing the strings and pointers without
   leaving any empty space hence, saving a lot of wasted space. We can understand this using the image
   shown below.

   Memory representation of an Array of Strings

            0    1    2    3    4    5    6    7    8    9
   arr[0] [ G ][ e ][ e ][ k ][ \0][XXX][XXX][XXX][XXX][XXX]
   arr[1] [ G ][ e ][ e ][ k ][ s ][ \0][XXX][XXX][XXX][XXX]
   arr[2] [ G ][ e ][ e ][ k ][ s ][ f ][ o ][ r ][ \o][XXX]

   [XXX] -- memory waste

   The space occupied by the array of pointers to characters is shown by solid green blocks excluding
   the memory required for storing the pointer while the space occupied by the array of strings includes
   both solid and light green blocks.

Array of Pointers to Different Types
   Not only we can define the array of pointers for basic data types like int, char, float, etc. but we
   can also define them for derived and user-defined data types such as arrays, structures, etc. Let's
   consider the below example where we create an array of pointers pointing to a function for performing
   the different operations.

   Example:

// C program to illustrate the use of array of pointers to
// function
#include <stdio.h>

// some basic arithmetic operations
void add(int a, int b) {
	printf("Sum : %d\n", a + b);
}

void subtract(int a, int b) {
	printf("Difference : %d\n", a - b);
}

void multiply(int a, int b) {
	printf("Product : %d\n", a * b);
}

void divide(int a, int b) {
	printf("Quotient : %d", a / b);
}

int main() {

	int x = 50, y = 5;

	// array of pointers to function of return type void
	void (*arr[4])(int, int) = { &add, &subtract, &multiply, &divide };
	for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
		arr[i](x, y);
	}
	return 0;
}

   Output
Sum : 55
Difference : 45
Product : 250
Quotient : 10

Application of Array of Pointers
   An array of pointers is useful in a wide range of cases. Some of these applications are listed below:
     * It is most commonly used to store multiple strings.
     * It is also used to implement LinkedHashMap in C and also in the Chaining technique of collision
       resolving in Hashing.
     * It is used in sorting algorithms like bucket sort.
     * It can be used with any pointer type so it is useful when we have separate declarations of
       multiple entities and we want to store them in a single place.

Disadvantages of Array of Pointers
   The array of pointers also has its fair share of disadvantages and should be used when the advantages
   outweigh the disadvantages. Some of the disadvantages of the array of pointers are:
     * Higher Memory Consumption: An array of pointers requires more memory as compared to plain arrays
       because of the additional space required to store pointers.
     * Complexity: An array of pointers might be complex to use as compared to a simple array.
     * Prone to Bugs: As we use pointers, all the bugs associated with pointers come with it so we need
       to handle them carefully.

Pointer to an Array | Array Pointer
30 Apr, 2025

   A pointer to an array is a pointer that points to the whole array instead of the first element of the
   array. It considers the whole array as a single unit instead of it being a collection of given
   elements.

   Example:

#include<stdio.h>

int main() {
	int arr[5] = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };
	int *ptr = arr;

	printf("%p\n", ptr);
	return 0;
}

   Output
0x7ffde273ac20

   In the above program, we have a pointer ptr that points to the 0^th element of the array. Similarly,
   we can also declare a pointer that can point to whole array instead of only one element of the array.
   This pointer is useful when talking about multidimensional arrays.

Syntax of Array Pointer
   An array pointer can be declared as shown:
type(*ptr)[size];

   where,
     * type: Type of data that the array holds.
     * ptr:  Name of the pointer variable.
     * size: Size of the array to which the pointer will point.

   For example,
int (*ptr)[10];

   Here ptr is pointer that points to an array of 10 integers. Since subscript have higher precedence
   than indirection, it is necessary to enclose the indirection operator and pointer name inside
   parentheses.

Examples of Pointer to Array
   The following examples demonstrate the use pf pointer to an array in C and also highlights the
   difference between the pointer to an array and pointer to the first element of an array.

Access Array Using Array Pointer
   In the below code, the type of ptr is pointer to an array of 10 integers.

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
	int arr[3] = { 5, 10, 15 };
	int n = sizeof(arr) / sizeof(arr[0]);

	// Declare pointer variable
	int (*ptr)[3];

	// Assign address of val[0] to ptr.
	// We can use ptr = &val[0]; (both are same)
	ptr = &arr;

	for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
		printf("%d ", (*ptr)[i]);

	return 0;
}

   Output
5 10 15

Find the Size of Array Passed to a Function
   Normally, it is impossible to find the size of array inside a function, but if we pass the pointer to
   an array, the it is possible.

#include <stdio.h>

// Function that takes array as argument
void foo(int (*arr)[5]) {
	printf("%lu ", sizeof(*arr));
}

int main() {
	int arr[5];

	// Passing the address of arr
	foo(&arr);

	return 0;
}

   Output
20

   But again, we have to hardcode the size information.

Pointer to the First Element of Array vs Array Pointer
   The pointer that points to the 0^th element of array and the array pointer that points to the whole
   array are totally different. The following program shows this:

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int arr[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

    // Create a pointer to integer
    int *p;

    // Pointer to an array of 5 integers
    int(*ptr)[5];

    // Points to 0th element of the arr
    p = arr;

    // Points to the whole array arr
    ptr = &arr;

        printf("p = %p\n", p);
        printf("*ptr = %p\n\n", *ptr);

        // incrementing both pointers
    p++;
    ptr++;
    printf("p = %p\n", *p);
        printf("*ptr = %p", ptr);

    return 0;
}

   Output
p    = 0x7fff81e4caf0
*ptr = 0x7fff81e4caf0

p    = 0x7fff81e4caf4
*ptr = 0x7fff81e4cb04

   Here, p is pointer to 0^th element of the array arr, while ptr is a pointer that points to the whole
   array arr.
     * The base type of p is int while base type of ptr is 'an array of 5 integers'.
     * We know that the pointer arithmetic is performed relative to the base size, so if we write ptr++,
       then the pointer ptr will be shifted forward by 20 bytes.

   The following figure shows the pointer p and ptr. The darker (double) arrow denotes a pointer to an array.
   (address may vary in each execution of the program)

     p
   [3000]--+
    2500    \
             \
              [ 3  ][ 5  ][ 6  ][ 7  ][ 9  ]
            // 3000  3004  3008  3012  3016
     ptr   //
   [3000]==+
    4500

   On dereferencing a pointer expression, we get a value pointed to by that pointer expression. The
   pointer to an array point to an array, so on dereferencing it, we should get the array, and the name
   of the array denotes the base address. So, whenever a pointer to an array is dereferenced, we get the
   base address of the array to which it points.

Pointer to Multidimensional Arrays
   The concept of pointer to an array can be extended to multidimensional arrays too:

   1. Pointers to 2D Arrays
   To define a pointer to a 2D array, both the number of rows and columns of the array must be specified
   in the pointer declaration.

type *(ptr)[row][cols]

   Let's take a look at an example:

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
	int arr[2][3] = {{1, 2, 3},
		{4, 5, 6}};

	// pointer to above array
	int (*ptr)[2][3] = &arr;

	// Traversing the arry using ptr
	for (int i = 0; i < 2; i++) {
		for (int j = 0; j < 3; j++) {
			printf("%d ", (*ptr)[i][j]);
		}
		printf("\n");
	}

	return 0;
}

   Output
1 2 3
4 5 6

2. Pointers to 3D Arrays
   To define a pointer to a 2D array, both the number of rows and columns of the array must be specified
   in the pointer declaration.

type *(ptr)[depth][row][cols]

   Let's take a look at an example:

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
	int arr[2][3][2] = {{{1, 2}, {3, 4}, {5, 6}},
		{{7, 8}, {9, 10}, {11, 12}}};

	// Pointer to the 3D array
	int (*ptr)[2][3][2] = &arr;

	// Traversing the 3D array using the pointer
	for (int i = 0; i < 2; i++) {
		for (int j = 0; j < 3; j++) {
			for (int k = 0; k < 2; k++) {
				printf("%d ", (*ptr)[i][j][k]);
			}
			printf("\n");
		}
		printf("\n");
	}

	return 0;
}

   Output
1 2
3 4
5 6

7 8
9 10
11 12
