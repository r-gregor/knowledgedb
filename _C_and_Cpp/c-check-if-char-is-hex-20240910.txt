How to check if char* only has hex characters in C?

   I have a char *argv[] that I want to check only contains valid hex values. For example I'm trying to
   write a function like bool isHex(argv[1]) and says if it only has hex. How do I ensure that it only
   has numbers 0-9 and letters a-f? I've found ways for all alpha or numbers but I'm not sure if there's
   an easier way for hex. Thanks.

***
   You can check a string's contents vs. any set of characters via the standard strspn() function.
   It computes the length of the initial segment of a specified string that consists exclusively of the
   specified characters:

unsigned hex_count = strspn(arg, "0123456789abcdef");
_Bool is_all_hex = !arg[hex_count];    // is arg[hex_count] a string terminator?

***
   For a reasonably performant solution, you can use a static lookup table:
#include <limits.h>

int isHex(char c) {
	static int s_hex_digit[1 << CHAR_BIT] = {
		['0'] = 1, ['1'] = 1, ['2'] = 1, ['3'] = 1, ['4'] = 1,
		['5'] = 1, ['6'] = 1, ['7'] = 1, ['8'] = 1, ['9'] = 1,
		['A'] = 1, ['B'] = 1, ['C'] = 1, ['D'] = 1, ['E'] = 1, ['F'] = 1,
		['a'] = 1, ['b'] = 1, ['c'] = 1, ['d'] = 1, ['e'] = 1, ['f'] = 1
	};
	return s_hex_digit[(unsigned char)c];
}

   This comes at the expense of some static memory, but not too much. Changing the array element type of
   s_hex_digit to char instead of int will save a bit of memory, which might work better with caches if
   you are doing this a lot.

   It has the benefit of having no branching (a performance consideration), but also working with any
   character encoding (e.g. non-ASCII).

***
   Read them as numbers: its value should be
     * between 48 (char 0) and 57 (char 9)
     * between 65 (char A) and 70 (char F)
     * between 97 (char a) and 102 (char f)

   (values taken from an ASCII table, such as this: http://www.asciitable.com/).

***
   Try isxdigit(), defined in <ctype.h>, which will match the digits 0 through 9 and the uppercase and
   lowercase letters A to F. On BSD and macOS, you can also use ishexnumber()

***
   You meant to say isxdigit() en.cppreference.com/w/c/string/byte/isxdigit ... ishexnumber is
   not a standard function.
