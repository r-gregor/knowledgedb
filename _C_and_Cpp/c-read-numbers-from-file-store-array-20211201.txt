C program to read numbers from a file and store them in an array

   In this post, we will learn how to read numbers from a text file and store them in an array in C. One
   text file is given and this file holds different number values. The C program will read all these
   values from that file and put them in an array. Also, it will print the array content.

Create the text file:

   For this example, create one file testfile.txt with the below text:
10
20
30
40
50

C Program:
   Below C program will read the numbers from the above text file and put them in an array. Create one
   example.c file in the same folder of testfile.txt with the below code:
<code>
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
	int numbers[50];
	int i = 0;
	FILE *file;

	if (file = fopen("testfile.txt", "r")) {
		while (fscanf(file, "%d", &numbers[i]) != EOF) {
			i++;
		}

		fclose(file);

		numbers[i] = '\0';

		for (i = 0; numbers[i] != '\0'; i++) {
			printf("%d\n", numbers[i]);
		}
	}

	return 0;
}
</code>

   Here,
	 * numbers is an array to hold the numbers
	 * file is the file pointer. This file pointer is used to hold the file reference once it is open.
	 * Using fopen, we are opening the file in read more. The r is used for read mode. If the file is
	   opened using fopen, it scans the content of the file.
	 * The while loop reads the file and puts the content i.e. the numbers in the numbers array. The i
	   is used to point to the current location in the array. It starts from 0 and it is incremented by
	   1 on each iteration.
	 * Once the while loop ends, we are closing the file using fclose. Also, as the reading is
	   completed, we are adding '\0' at the end of the array.
	 * The last for loop is used to print the contents of the numbers array, i.e. the numbers of the
	   text file.

Output:
   It will print the contents of the file, i.e. the numbers.
