Sockets - Sending emails using C

   I have just started learning about socket programming and learned about winsock and achieved some
   progress. my question is basically: I want to send emails, what should I do?

   points to be mentioned:
    1. I learned about initializing winsock. SMTP port (25). creating and connecting to sockets
       successfully. What should I do now?!!! (I'm stuck here)
    2. I don't want a ready-for-work code. I wanna learn. So, any books, documentations, tutorials or
       articles recommendations are needed.
    3. I know that C itself knows nothing about networking, does that mean I have to download some
       libraries? (I am using VS2010, Windows 7)

   Here are the links to pages I have read so far:

   basic winsock guide:
   http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms737629(v=vs.85).aspx

   I have read the first 14 pages from beej guide (can't post the link, new users can only post a
   maximum of two hyperlinks)

   I have learned about the types ( WSADATA, addrinfo structure, sockaddr, SOCKET ) and functions (
   WSAStartup(), WSACleanup(), getaddrinfo(), Shutdown(), WSAGetLastError(), socket(), ... )

   and I have just started reading this article about SMTP http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc821.html

   here's what I have written till now:
#include <stdio.h>
#include <WinSock2.h>
#include <WS2tcpip.h>

#pragma comment(lib, "Ws2_32.lib") // Applications that use Winsock must be linked with the Ws2_32.lib
                                   // library file.

#define HTTP_PORT "80"
#define SMTP_PORT "25"
#define HOSTNAME_PORT "101"

/*
All ports and web services names ( which are string aliases of the ports

 can be found here:
 %WINDIR%\system32\drivers\etc\services

 */

int main(void) {
	WSADATA wsdata;
	int iresult, retval; //iresult : instant result
	SOCKET connect_socket;
	struct addrinfo *result, *ptr, hints;

	iresult = WSAStartup(MAKEWORD(2, 2), &wsdata);

	if(iresult != 0) printf("Initiation of Winsock succeeded.\n");
	else {
		printf("WinSock initialization failed..\n");
		WSACleanup();
		return 0;
	}

	if(LOBYTE(wsdata.wVersion) == 2 && HIBYTE(wsdata.wVersion) == 2) printf("winsock.dll is found.\n");
	else {
		printf("Can not find the required winsock.dll file.\n");
		WSACleanup();
		return 0;
	}

	ZeroMemory(&hints, sizeof(hints));
	hints.ai_family = AF_UNSPEC;     // IPv4 or IPv6
	hints.ai_protocol = IPPROTO_TCP; // TCP connection ( full duplex )
	hints.ai_socktype = SOCK_STREAM; // Provides sequenced, reliable, two-way, connection-based byte streams

	connect_socket = socket(hints.ai_family, hints.ai_socktype, hints.ai_protocol);

	if(connect_socket == INVALID_SOCKET) {
		printf("Socket Creation failed..\n");
		WSACleanup();
		return 0;
	} else printf("Socket Creation Succeeded ..\n");
	WSACleanup();
	return 1;
}

   am I off course?

Best Solution

   You should take a look at [http://www.yuki-onna.co.uk/email/smtp.html]some examples on smtp via telnet :)

   Basically you need to input in plaintext something like this:
HELO local.domain.name
MAIL FROM: mail@domain.ext
RCPT TO: mail@otherdomain.ext
DATA
...

   EDIT according to [http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/bb530747(v=vs.85).aspx]this
   example, your code should be:
   
// Not sure about this one, maybe just "\n"
#define  SEPARATOR "\n\r"

int sendData( Socket *socket, const char *data) {
	int iResult;
	iResult = send(socket, data, (int) strlen(data), 0);
	if(iResult == SOCKET_ERROR){
		// Do error handling as you like
	}
	return iResult;
}

sendData( socket, "HELO local.doman.name" SEPARATOR);
sendData( socket, "MAIL FROM: mail@domain.ext" SEPARATOR);
sendData( socket, "RCPT TO: mail@otherdomain.ext" SEPARATOR);
sendData( socket, "DATA" SEPARATOR);
sendData( socket, "This is subject of my mail" SEPARATOR SEPARATOR);
sendData( socket, "And this is text" SEPARATOR);
sendData( socket, "." SEPARATOR); // Send mail
