How to write your own Malloc and Free using C?

   Here, I am going to present you one of the simplest and easy-to-understand code for the implementation of
   the Malloc and Free functions that are used for the Dynamic memory allocation and deallocation in C.

   This code will work fine when run on a Linux operating system.
   [http://tharikasblogs.blogspot.com/p/include-include-include-mymalloc.html]Click here to get the full code.

   The concept behind it is, The block of memory containing the metadata (data about data) is stored adjacent
   to the specific block of allocated memory about which it refers to. This metadata block, or more
   specifically the linked list structure (as shown in the above diagram), is required because we need to know
   whether a particular block is free or whether it is already being allocated and also to know the size of
   the block which it refers to. This is the metadata block structure,

struct block {
	size_t size;
	int free;
	struct block *next;
};

   Here, I assumed a block of memory of size 20,000 bytes char memory[20000];  (assuming that the storage for
   a character is 1 byte in the machine) and all the data structures and the allocated memory blocks reside in
   this same chunk of memory.  Now I will explain the code, part by part :

   This is the C code for the header file required.
   mymalloc.h       (Name your header file in this way)

#include<stdio.h>
#include<stddef.h>

   stddef.h is required because the definition for size_t datatype is found there.

char memory[20000];

   This is the declaration of the array which is considered as our memory. We get a contiguous
   allocation of memory by using an array.

/*The structure definition to contain metadata of each block allocated or deallocated*/
struct block {
	size_t size; /*Carries the size of the block described by it*/
	int free;    /*This flag is used to know whether the block described by the metadata structure is free or
	               not -- > if free, it is set to 1. Otherwise 0. */
	struct block *next; /*Points to the next metadata block*/
};

/*Pointing to the main block of memory which is initially free (no storage allocation yet)*/
struct block *freeList=(void*)memory;

   Here we initialize a pointer of type "block", named freeList pointing to the starting address of the
   chunk of memory we created before. This freeList pointer will point to the start of the linked list
   of metadata blocks.The starting address of the array (memory) should be casted to type void so that
   we are able to allocate blocks of memory which are of different datatypes.(int, char, float etc.)

/*The function definitions which are defined in the next source file malloc.c*/
void initialize();
void split(struct block *fitting_slot,size_t size);
void *MyMalloc(size_t noOfBytes);
void merge();
void MyFree(void* ptr);

   This is the C code for the implementation of the malloc and free functions
   mymalloc.c        (Name your source file in this way)

#include<stdio.h>
#include<stddef.h>
#include "mymalloc.h" /*Here we include the header file given above*/

/*Initializing the block of memory*/
void initialize() {
	freeList->size=20000-sizeof(struct block);
	freeList->free=1;
	freeList->next=NULL;
}

   This is where we initialize the first metadata block update it to refer to the next block of memory.
     * The size of the block that it refers to is (20000 bytes- the_size_of_one_metadata_block)
     * To indicate that the block is not yet allocated, we set the free flag to 1.
     * And the first metadata block has no next metadata block yet. So we set next to NULL.

/*Making way for a new block allocation by splitting a free block -- (Assume first fit algorithm)*/
void split(struct block *fitting_slot,size_t size) {
	struct block *new=(void*)((void*)fitting_slot+size+sizeof(struct block));
	new->size=(fitting_slot->size)-size-sizeof(struct block);
	new->free=1;
	new->next=fitting_slot->next;
	fitting_slot->size=size;
	fitting_slot->free=0;
	fitting_slot->next=new;
}
   We use the First-fit-algorithm to find a free block to allocate memory. Assume that we
   get a request to allocate a block of memory of size 500 bytes. Starting from the first metadata block
   we can go on searching for the first block which has enough space to allocate. If we get the free
   block sizes to be 250, 130 and 750 in order, we will allocate the block of size 750.
   If we find a free block which exactly fits the required size, we don't need to do the
   splitting. So this function is only required if we have what is more than required.
   The arguments accepted by this function are --- A pointer to the metadata block which
   refers to the block of memory whose size is more than required.(fitting_slot) and the required size
   of the memory chunk to be allocated.

   Here we create a new metadata block pointer called "new". And it should point to the
   location provided by passing(setting aside) a block of memory which is equal to
   the_size_of_the_metadata_block_we_considered + the_size_requested_to_be_allocated
   Then this new pointer points to the metadata block referring to the next free chunk.
   As you can see from the code, I have set the attributes of both the new and fitting_slot metadata
   blocks accordingly.

   Note: The malloc and free functions are named here as MyMalloc() and MyFree().

/*Function MyMalloc(malloc)*/
void *MyMalloc(size_t noOfBytes) {
	struct block *curr,*prev;

   We need metadata block pointers to traverse through the freeList.

	void *result;

   This result pointer is to return the starting address of the allocated chunk of memory.

	if (!(freeList->size)) {
		initialize();
		printf("Memory initialized\n");
	}

   This condition will initialize the memory if it is not initialized at the beginning. This set of
   statements will be executed only if the size of the first metadata block is not set yet. That means,
   if the memory is still not initialized.

	curr=freeList;

   Now we make the temporary pointer curr to pint to the start of the metadata block list.

	while((((curr->size)<noOfBytes)||((curr->free)==0))&&(curr->next!=NULL)) {

   If this condition is met, the metadata block we checked cannot be used for the allocation. So we
   execute the following statements. That is you go on checking one metadata block at a time.

		prev=curr;
		curr=curr->next;
		printf("One block checked\n");
	}

	if ((curr->size)==noOfBytes) {

   If this condition is met, the metadata block we checked refers to a chunk of memory that exactly fits
   the required size. So set the free flag to 0, indicating that it is allocated. Then return the
   starting address of the block of allocated memory.

		curr->free=0;
		result=(void*)(++curr);
		printf("Exact fitting block allocated\n");
		return result;
	} else if ((curr->size)>(noOfBytes+sizeof(struct block))) {

   If this condition is met, the metadata block we checked refers to a chunk of memory that is of size
   greater than what is required. So invoke the split() function to allocate only the block which is
   required and then return the starting address of the block of allocated memory.

		split(curr,noOfBytes);
		result=(void*)(++curr);
		printf("Fitting block allocated with a split\n");
		return result;
	}

   Else it means that there is no sufficient memory to allocate so you should return a NULL pointer.

	else {
		result=NULL;
		printf("Sorry. No sufficient memory to allocate\n");
		return result;
	}
}

   There can be a situation where you have consecutive blocks that are set free by deallocating
   after they were previously allocated. This results in external fragmentation which will cause the
   MyMalloc() function to return a NULL pointer although we have enough memory to allocate. Therefore we
   use a function called merge() to join the consecutive free blocks by removing the metadata blocks
   lying in between.

/*This is to merge the consecutive free blocks by removing the metadata block in the middle. This
will save space.*/
void merge() {
	struct block *curr,*prev;
	curr=freeList;
	while((curr->next)!=NULL) {
		if ((curr->free) && (curr->next->free)) {
			curr->size+=(curr->next->size)+sizeof(struct block);
			curr->next=curr->next->next;
		}
		prev=curr;
		curr=curr->next;
	}
}
   After we allocate memory for some purpose, it is a really good practice to deallocate that memory if
   you have finished using it, so that it can be used by another person for his memory requirement.
   We use the MyFree() function for that.

   It takes the pointer to a block of memory previously allocated as a parameter.

/*Function MyFree(free)*/
void MyFree(void* ptr) {
	if (((void*)memory<=ptr)&&(ptr<=(void*)(memory+20000))) {

   Here we check whether the address to which the pointer given as an argument to the
   function actually lies within the address range of the memory array that we used for the purpose. If
   yes,we simply set the free flag in the metadata block to 1 indicating that it is free and scan
   through and merge the consecutive blocks that are free, if any.

		struct block* curr=ptr;
		--curr;
		curr->free=1;
		merge();
	} else printf("Please provide a valid pointer allocated by MyMalloc\n");
}

   If a valid pointer is not provided, the above message will be printed.
   So that is the detailed explanation of the code. (You can click the link given at the top of the page
   to get access to the full code)

   I hope you got a better understanding on how to implement your own malloc and free functions using C.
   Thank you!
