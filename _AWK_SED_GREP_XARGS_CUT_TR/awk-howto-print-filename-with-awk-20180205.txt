How to print filename with awk on Linux / Unix
February 3, 2018

   I would like to print filename with awk on Linux / Unix-like system. How do I print filename in BEGIN
   section of awk? Can I print the name of the current input file using gawk/awk?
   The name of the current input file set in FILENAME variable. You can use FILENAME to display or print
   current input file name If no files are specified on the command line, the value of FILENAME is “-”
   (stdin). However, FILENAME is undefined inside the BEGIN rule unless set by getline.

How to print filename with awk
   The syntax is:
   awk '{ print FILENAME }' fileNameHere
   awk '{ print FILENAME }' /etc/hosts
   You might see file name multiple times as awk read file line-by-line. To avoid this problem update
   your awk/gawk syntax as follows:
   awk 'FNR == 1{ print FILENAME } ' /etc/passwd
   awk 'FNR == 1{ print FILENAME } ' /etc/hosts

How to print filename in BEGIN section of awk
   Use the following syntax:
   awk 'BEGIN{print ARGV[1]}' fileNameHere
   awk 'BEGIN{print ARGV[1]}{ print "someting or do something on data" }END{}' fileNameHere
   awk 'BEGIN{print ARGV[1]}' /etc/hosts
   Sample outputs:
/etc/hosts

   However, ARGV[1] might not always work. For example:
   ls -l /etc/hosts | awk 'BEGIN{print ARGV[1]} { print }'
   So you need to modify it as follows (assuming that ls -l only produced a single line of output):
   ls -l /etc/hosts | awk '{ print "File: " $9 ", Owner:" $3 ", Group: " $4 }'
   Sample outputs:
File: /etc/hosts, Owner:root, Group: roo

How to deal with multiple filenames specified by a wild card
   Use the following simple syntax:
   awk '{ print FILENAME; nextfile } ' *.c
   awk 'BEGIN{ print "Starting..."} { print FILENAME; nextfile }END{ print "....DONE"} ' *.conf
   Sample outputs:
Starting...

   nextfile tells awk to stop processing the current input file. The next input record read comes from
   the next input file. For more information see awk/[19]gawk command man page:
   man awk
   man gawk
