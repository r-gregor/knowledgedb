Using sed and Bash to Fill Empty Cells in a CSV File
11 June 2024

Dealing with CSV files containing empty cells can be challenging, especially when trying to process or
analyze data programmatically. In this article, we will explore how to use Bash and the powerful text
stream editor sed to fill these empty cells efficiently. This approach ensures that your data is complete
and ready for further manipulation or analysis.

In this tutorial you will learn:
 * How to identify and handle empty cells in a CSV file
 * How to use sed and Bash to automate the filling of empty cells

Let's dive into the process of filling empty cells in a CSV file using a combination of sed and
Bash. This method is both efficient and straightforward, allowing you to automate the task with ease.

Prepare the CSV File: First, create a sample CSV file with some empty cells. This will be the file
we work with.

$> cat myfile.csv
1,2,3,4,5,6,7
,,,,,,
1,,,4,5,,
,2,3,4,5,,

This CSV file contains several rows, some of which have empty cells that need to be filled.
Create the Bash Script: Next, create a Bash script that will use sed to fill the empty cells. Save
the following script to a file, e.g., fill_empty_cells.sh.

#!/bin/bash

for i in $( seq 1 2); do
	sed -e "s/^,/$2,/" -e "s/,,/,$2,/g" -e "s/,$/,$2/" -i $1
done

This script processes the CSV file twice to ensure all empty cells are filled. It replaces:
  - An empty cell at the beginning of a line with the specified value.
  - Consecutive commas indicating empty cells between values with the specified value.
  - An empty cell at the end of a line with the specified value.

Run the Script: Execute the script with the CSV file and the desired replacement value as arguments. For
example, to replace empty cells with NA:

$> bash fill_empty_cells.sh myfile.csv NA

This command processes myfile.csv, filling all empty cells with NA.
Verify the Changes: Finally, verify that the empty cells have been filled correctly by viewing the
modified CSV file.

$> cat myfile.csv
1,2,3,4,5,6,7
NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
1,NA,NA,4,5,NA,NA
NA,2,3,4,5,NA,NA

As shown above, all empty cells in the original CSV file have been replaced with NA, ensuring the
file is now complete.

Conclusion
Using sed and Bash to fill empty cells in a CSV file is an efficient and effective method. This approach
can be easily integrated into your data preprocessing workflow, ensuring that your CSV files are always
ready for analysis. With these steps, you can automate the process and handle even large datasets with ease.
