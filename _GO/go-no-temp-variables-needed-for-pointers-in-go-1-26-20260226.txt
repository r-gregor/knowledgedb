No temp variables needed for pointers in Go 1.26
2026.02.23

   How many millions of times have you seen this pattern in Go where a variable is pre-created just to
   make a pointer to it down the line? There is a high chance your codebase includes a utility to do
   that.

// Something like this
a := 123
aPtr := &a

// Or like this
func Pointer[T any](v T) *T {
	return &v
}

bPtr := Pointer(456)

   Go 1.26 makes this a lot simpler by extending the functionality of the built-in new function.
   In addition to taking a type as an argument just to return its zero value, it now also accepts an
   expression. All the examples from above become one-liners.

aPtr := new(123)
bPtr := new(456)

   So handy! Thanks Go!
