Using Command Line Flags in Go
Jul 25, 2017

   There are many ways to process CLI flags using Go. The first option is to not use any library at all,
   and inspect os.Args. The second option is to use the standard library flag package. The third
   option is to use one of the many 3rd party CLI libs out there, like Cobra.

   Let's talk about the second option: using the standard library flag, as it offers many benefits over
   raw parsing of os.Args and it's built-in.

   Add import "flag" to the import section of your package, and it's ready to use.

   To accept an int parameter type:
func Int(name string, value int, usage string) *int

var count = flag.Int("count", 5, "the count of items")
fmt.Println("count value ", *count)

   The first parameter is the flag name as used in the CLI command, the second parameter is the default
   value, and the third is the description.

   An alternative syntax is provided by flag.IntVar():
func IntVar(p *int, name string, value int, usage string)

var count int
flag.IntVar(&count, "count", 5, "the count of items")
fmt.Println("count value ", count)

   Here the parameters are shifted, and the first parameter is the variable reference.

   The main difference is that in the first case, you get a pointer. In the second case, you get a
   value.

   flag provides many functions to parse different flag types, you'll need to use a different one for
   each type you want to accept:
func Bool(name string, value bool, usage string) *bool
func BoolVar(p *bool, name string, value bool, usage string)
func Duration(name string, value time.Duration, usage string) *time.Duration
func DurationVar(p *time.Duration, name string, value time.Duration, usage string)
func Float64(name string, value float64, usage string) *float64
func Float64Var(p *float64, name string, value float64, usage string)
func Int(name string, value int, usage string) *int
func Int64(name string, value int64, usage string) *int64
func Int64Var(p *int64, name string, value int64, usage string)
func IntVar(p *int, name string, value int, usage string)
func String(name string, value string, usage string) *string
func StringVar(p *string, name string, value string, usage string)
func Uint(name string, value uint, usage string) *uint
func Uint64(name string, value uint64, usage string) *uint64
func Uint64Var(p *uint64, name string, value uint64, usage string)
func UintVar(p *uint, name string, value uint, usage string)

   Passing the wrong type for a flag will raise an error, halt the program, and the required usage will
   be printed to the user.

   As an example, here's how you parse a string:
var description = flag.String("description", "default value", "the description of the flag")

Flags syntax

   How do you set flag? Simple: attach -flagname to your CLI command, with 4 alternative but equivalent
   syntaxes:
-count=x
-count x
--count=x
--count x

   You can pass as many flags as you want to a command, but the first time flag does not recognize a
   flag, it will stop parsing the additional ones. This means that flags must all go at the beginning,
   if you have non-flag parameters as well.

Parse the flags
   After defining all your flags, you need to call
flag.Parse()

   to actually parse them.

Boolean flags
   Boolean flags can be set just by adding -count, which makes the boolean flag get the true value. To
   set a false value, use -count=false. Any of those values are valid for boolean flags: 1, 0, t, f, T,
   F, true, false, TRUE, FALSE, True, False.

Short alternative

   Many times in the real world you'll see CLI apps accepting a flag with a descriptive name, and the
   same flag with a letter abbreviation. You can do it by providing 2 flag handlers:
var gopherType string

func init() {
    const (
        defaultGopher = "pocket"
        usage         = "the variety of gopher"
    )
    flag.StringVar(&gopherType, "gopher_type", defaultGopher, usage)
    flag.StringVar(&gopherType, "g", defaultGopher, usage+" (shorthand)")
}

Parsing non-flag parameters
   The flag package provides methods to also parse non-flag parameters.
flag.Args()

   returns a slice of strings with the parameters not parsed as flags.

Forcing a flag as required
   The flag package does not provide a built-in solution for this problem. You need to manage this case
   yourself:
// [...]
flag.Parse()

if *count == "" {
    flag.PrintDefaults()
    os.Exit(1)
}

   This is an introductory article. You can go into more in-depth topics from here, like implementing
   subcommands and definining your own flag types. See

How To Use the Flag Package in Go
November 7, 2019

Introduction
   Command-line utilities are rarely useful out of the box without additional configuration. Good
   defaults are important, but useful utilities need to accept configuration from users. On most
   platforms, command-line utilities accept flags to customize the command's execution. Flags are
   key-value delimited strings added after the name of the command. Go lets you craft command-line
   utilities that accept flags by using the flag package from the standard library.

   In this tutorial you'll explore various ways to use the flag package to build different kinds of
   command-line utilities. You'll use a flag to control program output, introduce positional arguments
   where you mix flags and other data, and then implement sub-commands.

Using a Flag to Change a Program's Behavior
   Using the flag package involves three steps: First, define variables to capture flag values, then
   define the flags your Go application will use, and finally, parse the flags provided to the
   application upon execution. Most of the functions within the flag package are concerned with defining
   flags and binding them to variables that you have defined. The parsing phase is handled by the
   Parse() function.

   To illustrate, you'll create a program that defines a Boolean flag that changes the message that
   will be printed to standard output. If there's a -color flag provided, the program will print a
   message in blue. If no flag is provided, the message will be printed without any color.

   Create a new file called boolean.go:
     * nano boolean.go

   Add the following code to the file to create the program:
   boolean.go
package main

import (
    "flag"
    "fmt"
)

type Color string

const (
    ColorBlack  Color = "\u001b[30m"
    ColorRed          = "\u001b[31m"
    ColorGreen        = "\u001b[32m"
    ColorYellow       = "\u001b[33m"
    ColorBlue         = "\u001b[34m"
    ColorReset        = "\u001b[0m"
)

func colorize(color Color, message string) {
    fmt.Println(string(color), message, string(ColorReset))
}

func main() {
    useColor := flag.Bool("color", false, "display colorized output")
    flag.Parse()

    if *useColor {
        colorize(ColorBlue, "Hello, DigitalOcean!")
        return
    }
    fmt.Println("Hello, DigitalOcean!")
}

   This example uses ANSI Escape Sequences to instruct the terminal to display colorized output.
   These are specialized sequences of characters, so it makes sense to define a new type for them. In
   this example, we've called that type Color, and defined the type as a string. We then define a
   palette of colors to use in the const block that follows. The colorize function defined after the
   const block accepts one of these Color constants and a string variable for the message to colorize.
   It then instructs the terminal to change color by first printing the escape sequence for the color
   requested, then prints the message, and finally requests that the terminal reset its color by
   printing the special color reset sequence.

   Within main, we use the flag.Bool function to define a Boolean flag called color. The second
   parameter to this function, false, sets the default value for this flag when it is not provided.
   Contrary to expectations you may have, setting this to true does not invert the behavior such that
   providing a flag will cause it to become false. Consequently, the value of this parameter is almost
   always false with Boolean flags.

   The final parameter is a string of documentation that can be printed as a usage message. The value
   returned from this function is a pointer to a bool. The flag.Parse function on the next line uses
   this pointer to set the bool variable based on the flags passed in by the user. We are then able to
   check the value of this bool pointer by dereferencing the pointer. More information about pointer
   variables can be found in the tutorial on pointers. Using this Boolean value, we can then call
   colorize when the -color flag is set, and call the fmt.Println variable when the flag is absent.

   Save the file and run the program without any flags:
     * go run boolean.go

   You'll see the following output:

   Output
Hello, DigitalOcean!

   Now run this program again with the -color flag:
     * go run boolean.go -color

   The output will be the same text, but this time in the color blue.

   Flags are not the only values passed to commands. You might also send file names or other data.

Working with Positional Arguments
   Typically commands will take a number of arguments that act as the subject of the command's focus.
   For example, the head command, which prints the first lines of a file, is often invoked as head
   example.txt. The file example.txt is a positional argument in the invocation of the head command.

   The Parse() function will continue to parse flags that it encounters until it detects a non-flag
   argument. The flag package makes these available through the Args() and Arg() functions.

   To illustrate this, you'll build a simplified re-implementation of the head command, which displays
   the first several lines of a given file:

   Create a new file called head.go and add the following code:
   head.go
package main

import (
    "bufio"
    "flag"
    "fmt"
    "io"
    "os"
)

func main() {
    var count int
    flag.IntVar(&count, "n", 5, "number of lines to read from the file")
    flag.Parse()

    var in io.Reader
    if filename := flag.Arg(0); filename != "" {
        f, err := os.Open(filename)
        if err != nil {
            fmt.Println("error opening file: err:", err)
            os.Exit(1)
        }
        defer f.Close()

        in = f
    } else {
        in = os.Stdin
    }

    buf := bufio.NewScanner(in)

    for i := 0; i < count; i++ {
        if !buf.Scan() {
            break
        }
        fmt.Println(buf.Text())
    }

    if err := buf.Err(); err != nil {
        fmt.Fprintln(os.Stderr, "error reading: err:", err)
    }
}

   First, we define a count variable to hold the number of lines the program should read from the file.
   We then define the -n flag using flag.IntVar, mirroring the behavior of the original head program.
   This function allows us to pass our own pointer to a variable in contrast to the flag functions
   that do not have the Var suffix. Apart from this difference, the rest of the parameters to
   flag.IntVar follow its flag.Int counterpart: the flag name, a default value, and a description. As in
   the previous example, we then call flag.Parse() to process the user's input.

   The next section reads the file. We first define an io.Reader variable that will either be set to the
   file requested by the user, or standard input passed to the program. Within the if statement, we use
   the flag.Arg function to access the first positional argument after all flags. If the user supplied a
   file name, this will be set. Otherwise, it will be the empty string (""). When a filename is present,
   we use the os.Open function to open that file and set the io.Reader we defined before to that file.
   Otherwise, we use os.Stdin to read from standard input.

   The final section uses a *bufio.Scanner created with bufio.NewScanner to read lines from the
   io.Reader variable in. We iterate up to the value of count using a for loop, calling break if
   scanning the line with buf.Scan produces a false value, indicating that the number of lines is less
   than the number requested by the user.

   Run this program and display the contents of the file you just wrote by using head.go as the file
   argument:
     * go run head.go -- head.go

   The -- separator is a special flag recognized by the flag package which indicates that no more flag
   arguments follow. When you run this command, you receive the following output:

   Output
package main

import (
        "bufio"
        "flag"

   Use the -n flag you defined to adjust the amount of output:
     * go run head.go -n 1 head.go

   This outputs only the package statement:

   Output
package main

   Finally, when the program detects that no positional arguments were supplied, it reads input from
   standard input, just like head. Try running this command:
     * echo "fish\nlobsters\nsharks\nminnows" | go run head.go -n 3

   You'll see the output:

   Output
fish
lobsters
sharks

   The behavior of the flag functions you've seen so far has been limited to examining the entire
   command invocation. You don't always want this behavior, especially if you're writing a command line
   tool that supports sub-commands.

Using FlagSet to Implement Sub-commands
   Modern command-line applications often implement "sub-commands" to bundle a suite of tools under a
   single command. The most well-known tool that uses this pattern is git. When examining a command like
   git init, git is the command and init is the sub-command of git. One notable feature of sub-commands
   is that each sub-command can have its own collection of flags.

   Go applications can support sub-commands with their own set of flags using the flag.(*FlagSet) type.
   To illustrate this, create a program that implements a command using two sub-commands with different
   flags.

   Create a new file called subcommand.go and add the following content to the file:
package main

import (
    "errors"
    "flag"
    "fmt"
    "os"
)

func NewGreetCommand() *GreetCommand {
    gc := &GreetCommand{
        fs: flag.NewFlagSet("greet", flag.ContinueOnError),
    }

    gc.fs.StringVar(&gc.name, "name", "World", "name of the person to be greeted")

    return gc
}

type GreetCommand struct {
    fs *flag.FlagSet

    name string
}

func (g *GreetCommand) Name() string {
    return g.fs.Name()
}

func (g *GreetCommand) Init(args []string) error {
    return g.fs.Parse(args)
}

func (g *GreetCommand) Run() error {
    fmt.Println("Hello", g.name, "!")
    return nil
}

type Runner interface {
    Init([]string) error
    Run() error
    Name() string
}

func root(args []string) error {
    if len(args) < 1 {
        return errors.New("You must pass a sub-command")
    }

    cmds := []Runner{
        NewGreetCommand(),
    }

    subcommand := os.Args[1]

    for _, cmd := range cmds {
        if cmd.Name() == subcommand {
            cmd.Init(os.Args[2:])
            return cmd.Run()
        }
    }

    return fmt.Errorf("Unknown subcommand: %s", subcommand)
}

func main() {
    if err := root(os.Args[1:]); err != nil {
        fmt.Println(err)
        os.Exit(1)
    }
}

   This program is divided into a few parts: the main function, the root function, and the individual
   functions to implement the sub-command. The main function handles errors returned from commands. If
   any function returns an error, the if statement will catch it, print the error, and the program
   will exit with a status code of 1, indicating that an error occurred to the rest of the operating
   system. Within main, we pass all of the arguments the program was invoked with to root. We remove the
   first argument, which is the name of the program (in the previous examples ./subcommand) by slicing
   os.Args first.

   The root function defines []Runner, where all sub-commands would be defined. Runner is an
   interface for sub-commands that allows root to retrieve the name of the sub-command using Name()
   and compare it against the contents subcommand variable. Once the correct sub-command is located
   after iterating through the cmds variable we initialize the sub-command with the rest of the
   arguments and invoke that command's Run() method.

   We only define one sub-command, though this framework would easily allow us to create others. The
   GreetCommand is instantiated using NewGreetCommand where we create a new *flag.FlagSet using
   flag.NewFlagSet. flag.NewFlagSet takes two arguments: a name for the flag set, and a strategy for
   reporting parsing errors. The *flag.FlagSet's name is accessible using the flag.(*FlagSet).Name
   method. We use this in the (*GreetCommand).Name() method so the name of the sub-command matches the
   name we gave to the *flag.FlagSet. NewGreetCommand also defines a -name flag in a similar way to
   previous examples, but it instead calls this as a method off the *flag.FlagSet field of the
   *GreetCommand, gc.fs. When root calls the Init() method of the *GreetCommand, we pass the arguments
   provided to the Parse method of the *flag.FlagSet field.

   It will be easier to see sub-commands if you build this program and then run it. Build the program:
     * go build subcommand.go

   Now run the program with no arguments:
     * ./subcommand

   You'll see this output:

   Output
You must pass a sub-command

   Now run the program with the greet sub-command:
     * ./subcommand greet

   This produces the following output:

   Output
Hello World !

   Now use the -name flag with greet to specify a name:
     * ./subcommand greet -name Sammy

   You'll see this output from the program:

   Output
Hello Sammy !

   This example illustrates some principles behind how larger command line applications could be
   structured in Go. FlagSets are designed to give developers more control over where and how flags are
   processed by the flag parsing logic.

Conclusion
   Flags make your applications more useful in more contexts because they give your users control over
   how the programs execute. It's important to give users useful defaults, but you should give them the
   opportunity to override settings that don't work for their situation. You've seen that the flag
   package offers flexible choices to present configuration options to your users. You can choose a few
   simple flags, or build an extensible suite of sub-commands. In either case, using the flag package
   will help you build utilities in the style of the long history of flexible and scriptable command
   line tools.

Go by Example: Command-Line Flags

Command-line flags are a common way to specify       |
options for command-line programs. For example, in   |
wc -l the -l is a command-line flag.                 |
                                                     | package main
                                                     |
Go provides a flag package supporting basic          | import (
command-line flag parsing. We’ll use this package to |     "flag"
implement our example command-line program.          |     "fmt"
                                                     | )
                                                     |
                                                     | func main() {
                                                     |
Basic flag declarations are available for string,    |
integer, and boolean options. Here we declare a      |
string flag word with a default value "foo" and a    |     wordPtr := flag.String("word", "foo", "a string")
short description. This flag.String function returns |
a string pointer (not a string value); we’ll see how |
to use this pointer below.                           |
                                                     |
This declares numb and fork flags, using a similar   |     numbPtr := flag.Int("numb", 42, "an int")
approach to the word flag.                           |     boolPtr := flag.Bool("fork", false, "a bool")
                                                     |
It’s also possible to declare an option that uses an |
existing var declared elsewhere in the program. Note |     var svar string
that we need to pass in a pointer to the flag        |     flag.StringVar(&svar, "svar", "bar", "a string var") 
declaration function.                                |
                                                     |
Once all flags are declared, call flag.Parse() to    |     flag.Parse()
execute the command-line parsing.                    |
                                                     |
                                                     |     fmt.Println("word:", *wordPtr)
Here we’ll just dump out the parsed options and any  |     fmt.Println("numb:", *numbPtr)
trailing positional arguments. Note that we need to  |     fmt.Println("fork:", *boolPtr)
dereference the pointers with e.g. *wordPtr to get   |     fmt.Println("svar:", svar)
the actual option values.                            |     fmt.Println("tail:", flag.Args())
                                                     | }
                                                     |
To experiment with the command-line flags program    |
it’s best to first compile it and then run the       | $ go build command-line-flags.go
resulting binary directly.                           | 
                                                     | 
                                                     | $ ./command-line-flags -word=opt -numb=7 -fork \
                                                     | -svar=flag
                                                     | word: opt
Try out the built program by first giving it values  | numb: 7
for all flags.                                       | fork: true
                                                     | svar: flag
                                                     | tail: []
                                                     | 
                                                     | $ ./command-line-flags -word=opt
                                                     | word: opt
Note that if you omit flags they automatically take  | numb: 42
their default values.                                | fork: false
                                                     | svar: bar

Dealing with Command Line Options in Golang: flag package

If you decide to write a command line tool, you’ll most likely want to get user input as command line options
and arguments. There are mainly three ways to handle this.

  * os.Args function
  * flag package
  * Libraries: go-flags, cli, cobra

I’m going to look at flag package in this post.

This is not about how to write a command line tool, and I don’t cover handling environmental variables nor
subcommands.

Example
Let’s assume we’re supposed to parse the following command in the following sections.

./go-curl -v -X "GET" https://example.com

where -v is a flag to print verbose message, -X is an option to specify the HTTP method, and it takes a url
as an argument.

The flag package

flag is go official utility package that makes it easy to parse command line input. You can take options in
bool, int, uint, string, time.Duration, float, and types you define. I show you the entire code first:

func main() {
        v := flag.Bool("v", false, "Makes  curl  verbose  during the operation.")
        var X string
        flag.StringVar(&X, "X", "GET", "(HTTP) Specifies a custom request method to use when communicating \
            with the HTTP server.")
        flag.Parse()
        args := flag.Args()
        
        // do curl here
        fmt.Printf("v: %t, X: %s, args: %v\n", *v, X, args)
        os.Exit(0)
}

There are two ways to define options.
1. Declare the variable as a pointer type
v := flag.Bool("v", false, "Makes  curl  verbose  during the operation.")

The functions Bool, String, Duration, etc. returns a pointer value that contains the option value. You can
specify the option name, the default value, and the description. As it’s a pointer, you need to dereference
(*v) when accessing it. By using a bool value, you can define the option without a parameter.

2. Use ~Var function
var X string
flag.StringVar(&X, "X", "GET", "(HTTP) Specifies a custom request method to use when communicating with the
HTTP server.")

You can declare the variable first and call the function with Var suffix. Although it becomes multiple lines,
you don’t need to care about pointers.

After declaring the options, you need call Parse function before using them.

flag.Parse()
Once you parse, you can get the arguments by calling flag.Args(). This is exactly the values after all the
options. For example, if the input is ./go-curl -v arg -opt value, the function returns ["arg", "-opt", "value"].

What if user put wrong options?
The process exit with code 2 as shown below:

$ ./go-curl -unknown-option
flag provided but not defined: -unknown-option
Usage of ./go-curl:
  -X string
        (HTTP) Specifies a custom request method to use when communicating with the HTTP server. (default "GET")
  -v    Makes  curl  verbose  during the operation.
$ echo $?
2

However, you might want to return your own exit code on exception. Or you might want to continue the process
without exiting. This is where FlagSet comes in.

FlagSet
flag package uses FlagSet struct underneath. When you call flag functions without receiver, it delegates the
process to the default FlagSet instance. If you want to change the exceptional behaviour you have three
options of how to deal with it.

  * ContinueOnError … Parse method returns error so you can handle it as you like.
  * ExitOnError … Parse exits with status code 2.
  * PanicOnError … Parse calls panic on exception.

For example, if you want to return 100 as exit status code on exception:

func main() {
        fs := flag.NewFlagSet("curl", flag.ContinueOnError)
        v := fs.Bool("v", false, "Makes  curl  verbose  during the operation.")
        var X string
        fs.StringVar(&X, "X", "GET", "(HTTP) Specifies a custom request method to use when communicating with \
            the HTTP server.")

        if err := fs.Parse(os.Args[1:]); err != nil {
                os.Exit(100)
        }        ...
}

(Be aware fs.Parse takes []string as input as opposed to the previous section.)

You can use FlagSet to implement subcommands as well. See the references below for details.

FlagSet prints nice error message to stderr like you saw in the previous section. Occasionally you might want
to suppress this message in testing for example. There’s a function SetOutput to change the output
destination.

Conclusion

One drawback of the flag package is its syntax as it doesn’t follow the UNIX conventions. Or, you might find
it’s not satisfactory in implementing complex subcommands. The libraries such as go-cmdline or cobra could be
your help.
