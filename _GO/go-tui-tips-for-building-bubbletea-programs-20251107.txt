0. Intro
   In the words of its authors Bubble Tea is a "powerful little TUI framework" for Go. It may be
   little but I found it had a steep learning curve before I could get truly comfortable with its power.
   I spent many a late night wrangling with broken layouts and unresponsive keys before learning the
   hard way where I had gone wrong. The result of my efforts is PUG, a full screen terminal
   interface for driving terraform:

  [img][pug tasks screenshot]

   I announced PUG on reddit and in response to a user I
   [https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1duart8/comment/lbhwwoj/]provided some pointers on using Bubble
   Tea.

   This blog post is a fuller exposition of that advice; it is not a tutorial but a series of tips (and
   tricks) to assist anyone in the development, debugging, and testing of their TUI. Much of what
   follows is informed from various issues and discussions on the Bubble Tea github project, where both
   users and the authors have provided invaluable expertise and guidance.

1. Keep the event loop fast
   Bubble Tea processes messages in an event loop:

func (p *Program) eventLoop(model Model, cmds chan Cmd) (Model, error) {
	for {
		select {
			case msg := <-p.msgs:
				// handle quit, window resize, etc
				// ...
				var cmd Cmd
				model, cmd = model.Update(msg) // run update
				cmds <- cmd                    // process command (if any)
				p.renderer.write(model.View()) // send view to renderer
		}
	}
}

   A message is received from the channel and sent to the Update() method on your model. The returned
   command is sent to a channel, to be invoked in a go routine elsewhere. Your model's View() method is
   then invoked before repeating the loop and processing the next message.

   Therefore Bubble Tea can only process messages as fast as as your Update() and View() methods. You
   want these methods to be fast otherwise your program may experience lag, resulting in an unresponsive
   UI. If your program generates a lot of messages they can back up and the program may appear to stall:
   a user presses a key and nothing happens for an indetermine amount of time.

   The key to writing a fast model is to offload expensive operations to a tea.Cmd:

func (m model) Update(msg tea.Msg) (tea.Model, tea.Cmd) {
	switch msg.(type) {
		case tea.KeyMsg:
		// don't do this:
		// time.Sleep(time.Minute)

		// do this:
		return m, func() tea.Msg {
			time.Sleep(time.Minute)
		}
	}
	return m, nil
}

2. Dump messages to a file
   When debugging it can be invaluable to see the messages your model is receiving. To do so, dump every
   message to a file and tail that file in another terminal. I recommend spew to pretty print the
   messages. The following dumps messages when DEBUG is set:

type model struct {
	dump io.Writer
}

func (m model) Init() tea.Cmd {
	return nil
}

func (m model) Update(msg tea.Msg) (tea.Model, tea.Cmd) {
	if m.dump != nil {
		spew.Fdump(m.dump, msg)
	}
	switch msg := msg.(type) {
		case tea.KeyMsg:
			switch msg.Type {
				case tea.KeyCtrlC:
					return m, tea.Quit
			}
	}
	return m, nil
}

func (m model) View() string { return "" }

func main() {
	var dump *os.File
	if _, ok := os.LookupEnv("DEBUG"); ok {
		var err error
		dump, err = os.OpenFile("messages.log", os.O_CREATE|os.O_TRUNC|os.O_WRONLY, 0o644)
		if err != nil {
			os.Exit(1)
		}
	}
	p := tea.NewProgram(model{dump: dump})

	if _, err := p.Run(); err != nil {
		fmt.Println("could not start program:", err)
		os.Exit(1)
	}
}

   Run the program then, in another terminal, tail messages.log. Go back to the program and type
   messages, enter, and then quit the program with Ctrl-C, and you should see the other terminal spew
   out:

$> tail -f messages.log
(tea.WindowSizeMsg) {
 Width: (int) 127,
 Height: (int) 30
}
(tea.KeyMsg) m
(tea.KeyMsg) e
(tea.KeyMsg) s
(tea.KeyMsg) s
(tea.KeyMsg) a
(tea.KeyMsg) g
(tea.KeyMsg) e
(tea.KeyMsg) s
(tea.KeyMsg) enter
(tea.KeyMsg) ctrl+c

   Note the first message received is the window resize message, which Bubble Tea sends to your program
   shortly after startup.

3. Live reload code changes
   Web app developers use livereload to see the effects of code changes in near real-time in the
   browser. You should do the equivalent for your TUI. I've cobbled together a couple of scripts for
   PUG:

#!/usr/bin/env bash

# in foreground, continously run app
while true; do
	_build/pug -w ./demo/ -d -l debug
done

#!/usr/bin/env bash

# watch code changes, trigger re-build, and kill process
while true; do
	go build -o _build/pug && pkill -f '_build/pug'
	inotifywait -e attrib $(find . -name '*.go') || exit
done

   I run the scripts in separate terminals. Whenever I save code changes the changes are visible pretty
   much immediately afterwards thanks to Go's fast compilation. This solution could be improved to
   handle a couple of shortcomings:
     * If I've messed up and PUG panics upon startup then it'll go into a death spin, restarting umpteen
       times a second until the error is fixed. A backoff mechanism would help here.
     * Starting and stopping these scripts is a bit of a pain. To stop them, I first need to stop the
       rebuild script, then use kill to terminate the other script.

   There are several tools out there like air that do "live reload for the CLI". But I found
   they didn't work with programs that are expecting standard input to be a TTY, which includes TUIs,
   but users in that same issue reported success with watchexec.

4. Use receiver methods on your model judiciously
   In Go, a method receiver can be passed as either a value or a pointer. When in doubt, one typically
   uses a pointer receiver, with a value receiver reserved for particular use cases.

   It can throw Go programmers then that the documented Bubble Tea models all have value receivers. It
   may be due to the fact Bubble Tea is based on the Elm Architecture, which is a purely functional
   pattern, where functions cannot change their internal state, and in Go a method with a value receiver
   cannot modify its receiver.

   However, you are free to set whatever receiver type you like. If you use a pointer receiver for your
   model and you make, say, a change to the model in Init() then that change is persisted:

type model struct {
	content string
}

func (m *model) Init() tea.Cmd {
	m.content = "initialized\n"
	return nil
}

func (m *model) Update(msg tea.Msg) (tea.Model, tea.Cmd) {
	switch msg := msg.(type) {
		case tea.KeyMsg:
			switch msg.Type {
				case tea.KeyCtrlC:
					return m, tea.Quit
			}
	}
	return m, nil
}

func (m *model) View() string { return m.content }

func main() {
	p := tea.NewProgram(&model{content: "uninitalized"})
	if _, err := p.Run(); err != nil {
		fmt.Println("could not start program:", err)
		os.Exit(1)
	}
}

   Returns:
initialized

   However, don't make the mistake of introducing a race condition by making changes outside of the
   event loop:

type model struct {
	content string
}

func (m *model) Init() tea.Cmd {
	go func() {
		m.content = "initialized\n"
	}()
	return nil
}

func (m *model) Update(msg tea.Msg) (tea.Model, tea.Cmd) {
	switch msg := msg.(type) {
		case tea.KeyMsg:
			switch msg.Type {
				case tea.KeyCtrlC:
					return m, tea.Quit
			}
	}
	return m, nil
}

func (m *model) View() string { return m.content }

func main() {
	p := tea.NewProgram(&model{content: "uninitalized"})
	if _, err := p.Run(); err != nil {
		fmt.Println("could not start program:", err)
		os.Exit(1)
	}
}

   If you repeatedly run this program you'll find it returns initialized some of the time and sometimes
   uninitialized. In the latter case, the event loop has already called View() before the go routine
   sets the content to initialized (see the event loop code above).

   Unless there is a good reason to do otherwise, stick to the normal message flow: any changes to the
   model should be made in Update() and returned immediately in the first return value. Straying from
   this course not only defies the natural order of Bubbletea, it also risks making it slower (see
   Keep the event loop fast).

   Using pointer receivers is not necessarily at odds with this advice. For instance, a pointer receiver
   is useful for helper methods:

func (m model) Update(msg tea.Msg) (tea.Model, tea.Cmd) {
	switch msg := msg.(type) {
		case tea.WindowSizeMsg:
			m.updateDimensions(msg.Width, msg.Height)
	}
	return m, nil
}

func (m *model) updateDimensions(width, height int) {
	m.width = width
	m.height = height
}

   There is a Github discussion on this subject, where there are different opinions on when to use
   pointer receivers.

5. Messages are not necessarily received in the order they are sent
   In Go, if you have more than one go routine sending to a channel, the order in which the sends and
   receives occur is unspecified:

   https://go.dev/play/p/G4-o8F6PsvU

func main() {
	ch := make(chan int)
	wg := sync.WaitGroup{}

	for i := range 10 {
		wg.Add(1)
		go func() {
			ch <- i
			wg.Done()
		}()
	}

	go func() {
		wg.Wait()
		close(ch)
	}()

	for i := range ch {
		fmt.Printf("%d\n", i)
	}
}

   Running the above can return something like this:
0512347689

   Now, in Bubble Tea, messages arrive from a number of sources, including:
    1. From user input, key presses, mouse movements, etc.
    2. Messages from tea commands (tea.Cmd).
    3. Explicitly sent using Send(msg).
    4. Signals such as window resize, suspend etc.

   User input messages are sent in a single routine:

// readAnsiInputs reads keypress and mouse inputs from a TTY and produces messages
// containing information about the key or mouse events accordingly.
func readAnsiInputs(ctx context.Context, msgs chan<- Msg, input io.Reader) error {
	// ...
	for {
		// Read and block.
		numBytes, err := input.Read(buf[:])

		// ...
		select {
			case msgs <- msg:
				// ...

   User input messages are therefore sent in order. Just as well otherwise entering words into, say, a
   text input would end up as gibberish.

   However, Bubble Tea commands are executed concurrently in separate go routines:

// handleCommands runs commands in a goroutine and sends the result to the
// program's message channel.
func (p *Program) handleCommands(cmds chan Cmd) chan struct{} {
	// ...
	case cmd := <-cmds:
		if cmd == nil {
			continue
		}
		// ...
		go func() {
			msg := cmd() // this can be long.
			p.Send(msg)
		}()

   As such, the messages they produce are sent in an unspecified order. Even if a command finishes
   before another command there is no guarantee its message will be sent and received first.

   The following demonstrates the point by explicitly sending messages using Send(msg) concurrently:

type model struct {
	received []int
}

func (m model) Init() tea.Cmd {
	return nil
}

func (m model) Update(msg tea.Msg) (tea.Model, tea.Cmd) {
	switch msg := msg.(type) {
		case nMsg:
			m.received = append(m.received, int(msg))
		case tea.KeyMsg:
				return m, tea.Quit
	}
	return m, nil
}

func (m model) View() string {
	return fmt.Sprintf("%v", m.received)
}

type nMsg int

func main() {
	p := tea.NewProgram(model{})

	for i := range 10 {
		go p.Send(nMsg(i))
	}

	if _, err := p.Run(); err != nil {
		fmt.Println("could not start program:", err)
			os.Exit(1)
	}
}

   Running the program produces:
$> go run main.go
[0 1 9 8 5 6 4 2 3 7]

   You cannot rely on the ordering of concurrently sent messages. If ordering matters you have a number
   of workarounds:
    1. Update model directly within Update():

func (m model) Update(msg tea.Msg) (tea.Model, tea.Cmd) {
	switch msg.(type) {
	case tea.KeyMsg:
		m.ordered = append(m.ordered, nextItem())
		// return func() tea.Msg {
		//   return nextItem()
		// }
	}
	return m, nil
}

       This may contradict with keeping Update fast.
    2. Use tea.Sequence to run commands in sequence, one at a time:

func (m model) Update(msg tea.Msg) (tea.Model, tea.Cmd) {
	switch msg.(type) {
		case tea.KeyMsg:
			return m, tea.Sequence(doThis, thenThat)
	}
	return m, nil
}

       See the [https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea#Sequence]docs.

   And finally, if ordering matters then try to refactor your program so that it doesn't. Embrace the
   chaos of concurrency.

6. Build a tree of models
   Any non-trivial Bubble Tea program outgrows a single model. There's a good chance you're using
   Charm's bubbles, which are models in their own right, each with a Init(), Update(), and View().
   You embed these models within your own model. The same applies to your own code: you may want to push
   your own components into separate models. The original model then becomes the "top-level" model,
   whose role becomes merely a message router and screen compositor, responsible for routing messages to
   the correct "child" models, and populating a layout with content from the child models' View()
   methods.

   And in turn the child models may embed models too, forming a tree of models: the root model receives
   all messages, which are relayed down the tree to the relevant child model, and the resulting model
   and command(s) are passed back up the tree, to be returned by the root model's Update() method. The
   same traversal then occurs with the rendering: the root model's View() method is called, which in
   turn calls child models' View() methods, and the resulting strings are passed back up the tree to be
   joined together and returned to the renderer.

   This is the model tree implemented in PUG, with arrows illustrating the routing of messages from
   model to model:

  [img][tree of models in PUG]

   The root model maintains a list or map of child models. Depending on your program, you may nominate a
   child model to be the "current" model, which is the one that is currently visible and the one the
   user interacts with. You might maintain a stack of previously visited models: when the user presses a
   key your program pushes another model onto the stack, and the top of the stack is then the current
   model. When the user presses a key to go "back" the model is "popped" off the stack and the previous
   model becomes the current model.

   You can opt to create your child models up front upon program startup. Or you could create them
   dynamically upon demand, which makes sense if conceptually they don't exist at startup or they may
   number into the thousands. In the case of PUG, a LogMessage model is only created when the user
   "drills down" into an individual log message. If you choose the dynamic approach it makes sense to
   maintain a cache of models to avoid unnecessarily re-creating models.

   The root model receives all messages. There are three main paths for routing decisions:
    1. Handle the message directly in the root model. e.g. "global keys" such those mapping to quit,
       help, etc,.
    2. Route the message to the current model (if you have one). e.g. all keys other than global keys,
       such as PageUp and PageDown to scroll up and down some content.
    3. Route the message to all child models, e.g. tea.WindowSizeMsg, which contains the current
       terminal dimensions and all child models may want to use it to calculate heights and widths for
       rendering content.

   None of the above is wrought in iron. It may not make sense for your particular program. However,
   Bubble Tea leaves architectural decisions to you and you'll need to make conscious decisions on how
   to manage the complexity that inevitably occurs once your program reaches a certain size.

7. Layout arithmetic is error-prone
   You are responsible for ensuring your program fits in the terminal. Its dimensions arrive in a
   tea.WindowSizeMsg message, which is sent shortly after the program starts, and whenever the terminal
   is resized. Your model records the dimensions and uses them when rendering to calculate the sizes of
   widgets.

   In this app, there are three widgets: a header, content, and a footer:

type model struct {
	width, height int
}

func (m model) Init() tea.Cmd {
	return nil
}

func (m model) Update(msg tea.Msg) (tea.Model, tea.Cmd) {
	switch msg := msg.(type) {
		case tea.KeyMsg:
			switch msg.Type {
				case tea.KeyCtrlC:
					return m, tea.Quit
			}
		case tea.WindowSizeMsg:
			m.width = msg.Width
				m.height = msg.Height
	}
	return m, nil
}

func (m model) View() string {
header := lipgloss.NewStyle().
			Align(lipgloss.Center).
			Width(m.width).
			Render("header")
			footer := lipgloss.NewStyle().
			Align(lipgloss.Center).
			Width(m.width).
			Render("footer")

			content := lipgloss.NewStyle().
			Width(m.width).
			// accommodate header and footer
			Height(m.height-1-1).
			Align(lipgloss.Center, lipgloss.Center).
			Render("content")

			return lipgloss.JoinVertical(lipgloss.Top, header, content, footer)
}

func main() {
	p := tea.NewProgram(model{}, tea.WithAltScreen())
	if _, err := p.Run(); err != nil {
		fmt.Println("could not start program:", err)
			os.Exit(1)
	}
}

   Which produces:

  [img][working layout]

   The header and footer are of fixed sizes, and the content widget takes whatever space is leftover.

   The code is then amended to add a border to the bottom of the header:

func (m model) View() string {
	header := lipgloss.NewStyle().
				Align(lipgloss.Center).
				Width(m.width).
				Border(lipgloss.NormalBorder(), false, false, true, false).
				Render("header")

	footer := lipgloss.NewStyle().
				Align(lipgloss.Center).
				Width(m.width).
				Render("footer")

	content := lipgloss.NewStyle().
			Width(m.width).
			// accommodate header and footer
			Height(m.height-1-1).
			Align(lipgloss.Center, lipgloss.Center).
			Render("content")

	return lipgloss.JoinVertical(lipgloss.Top, header, content, footer)
}

   But this breaks the layout, forcing the header off the terminal:

  [img][broken layout]

   The problem is that the arithmetic has not been updated to accommodate the border. The code is
   brittle, using hard coded heights which can easily be forgotten about when updating code. The fix is
   to use lipgloss's Height() and Width() methods to reference heights and widths of widgets:

func (m model) View() string {
	header := lipgloss.NewStyle().
			Align(lipgloss.Center).
			Width(m.width).
			Border(lipgloss.NormalBorder(), false, false, true, false).
			Render("header")

	footer := lipgloss.NewStyle().
			Align(lipgloss.Center).
			Width(m.width).
			Render("footer")

	content := lipgloss.NewStyle().
			Width(m.width).
			Height(m.height-lipgloss.Height(header)-lipgloss.Height(footer)).
			Align(lipgloss.Center, lipgloss.Center).
			Render("content")

	return lipgloss.JoinVertical(lipgloss.Top, header, content, footer)
}

   Which fixes the layout:

  [img][fixed layout]

   Now when changes are made to widget sizes the layout adapts accordingly.

   As your program gets more complex, with more widgets and more models, it's important to be
   disciplined with setting dimensions, to avoid frustratingly trying to track down what has caused the
   layout to break.

8. Recovering your terminal
   Bubble Tea recovers gracefully from panics occuring in the event loop but not if it occurs in a
   command:

type model struct{}

func (m model) Init() tea.Cmd {
	return nil
}

func (m model) Update(msg tea.Msg) (tea.Model, tea.Cmd) {
	return m, func() tea.Msg {
		panic("error")
	}
}

func (m model) View() string { return "" }

func main() {
	p := tea.NewProgram(model{}, tea.WithAltScreen())
	if _, err := p.Run(); err != nil {
		fmt.Println("could not start program:", err)
		os.Exit(1)
	}
}

   Which when invoked causes this:

  [img][unreset terminal following panic]

   Note the stack trace is malformed and there is no cursor. Because the panic was not recovered, the
   terminal was not reset to its previous settings, with raw mode disabled etc, and any characters you
   type are no longer echoed.

   To recover your terminal, reset it:
reset

   You should then regain your cursor and your terminal's previous settings.
   Note: there is an open issue for this bug.

9. Use teatest for end-to-end tests
   For end to end testing of your TUI, Charm have developed teatest, which they introduced last year
   in a blog article.

   Here's an program that runs and then quits upon confirmation from the user:

type model struct {
	quitting bool
}

func (m model) Init() tea.Cmd {
	return nil
}

func (m model) Update(msg tea.Msg) (tea.Model, tea.Cmd) {
	switch msg := msg.(type) {
		case tea.KeyMsg:
			switch msg.Type {
				case tea.KeyCtrlC:
					m.quitting = true
						return m, nil
			}

			if m.quitting {
				switch {
					case msg.String() == "y":
						return m, tea.Quit
					default:
							m.quitting = false
				}
			}
	}
	return m, nil
}

func (m model) View() string {
	if m.quitting {
		return "Quit? (y/N)"
	} else {
		return "Running."
	}
}

   And here's the test:

func TestQuit(t *testing.T) {
	m := model{}
	tm := teatest.NewTestModel(t, m)
	waitForString(t, tm, "Running.")
	tm.Send(tea.KeyMsg{Type: tea.KeyCtrlC})
	waitForString(t, tm, "Quit? (y/N)")
	tm.Type("y")
	tm.WaitFinished(t, teatest.WithFinalTimeout(time.Second))
}

func waitForString(t *testing.T, tm *teatest.TestModel, s string) {
	teatest.WaitFor(
			t,
			tm.Output(),
			func(b []byte) bool {
				return strings.Contains(string(b), s)
			},
			teatest.WithCheckInterval(time.Millisecond*100),
			teatest.WithDuration(time.Second*10),
	)
}

   As you can see the test emulates the user pressing keys and checking that the program responds in
   kind, before checking the program has finished.

   While this particular test is only checking for sub-strings, the blog article linked above shows how
   teatest supports using "golden files", where the entire output is captured the first time the test is
   run, and subsequent tests then check the content matches the captured output. That's useful for
   regression testing of content, but does mean you need to re-generate the golden files everytime you
   make even minor changes to the content of your program.

   Note: as of writing teatest is part of Charm's experimental repo, which means there is no promise
   of backwards compatibility.

10. Record demos and screenshots on VHS
   This one isn't about building your program per se but testing and documenting and presenting it to
   your audience. Charm make lots of nice tools for the terminal and VHS is one such tool that meets
   this requirement to a tee.

   With one declarative script you can produce both animated gifs and screenshot pngs. Here is a snippet
   from the script for PUG:

Output demo/demo.gif

Set Shell "bash"
Set FontSize 14
Set Width 1200
Set Height 800
Set Framerate 24
Set Padding 5

Hide
Type `go run main.go` Enter
Sleep 1s
Show

# init all modules
Ctrl+a Sleep 0.5s Type "i"
# we're taken to the init task group page
Sleep 0.5s
# preview output for several tasks
Down Sleep 0.5s Down Sleep 0.5s Down Sleep 0.5s

...
# go back to modules
Type "m" Sleep 0.5s
# take screen shot of modules (sleep to ensure page doesn't switch too soon)
Screenshot demo/modules.png Sleep 0.5s

   VHS calls the script a "tape" and you record the resulting gif by running:

vhs demo.tape

   Which then outputs the animated gif specified in the tape. Here is the full animated gif for PUG:

  [img][pug demo]

   Commit your tape alongside your code. You can opt to record a new video as part of your build
   pipeline. The same tape can produce screenshots which again form part of your (manual) testing as
   well as documentation.

   Indeed, the screenshots and animated gifs in this article were recorded on VHS, and can be found
   alongside the tapes in the blog's repo.

11. And more...
   I'll endeavour to keep adding more tips as I come across them. But there is no substitute for reading
   the code of Bubble Tea and Bubble Tea-based projects. I invite you to read the code of PUG, which
   implements several components that may be of use to your own project:
     * Table widget, with selections, sorting, filtering, and custom row rendering.
     * Split model: split screen with table and preview panes; adjustable/toggleable split.
     * Navigator: makes and caches models; history tracker.
     * Integration tests: using teatest for end-to-end testing.
