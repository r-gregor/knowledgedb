How to Clear RAM Memory Cache, Buffer and Swap Space on Linux
August 12, 2021

   Like any other operating system, GNU/Linux has implemented memory management efficiently and even
   more than that. But if any process is eating away your memory and you want to clear it, Linux
   provides a way to flush or clear ram cache.

How to Clear Cache in Linux?
   Every Linux System has three options to clear cache without interrupting any processes or services.

   1. Clear PageCache only.
# sync; echo 1 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches

   2. Clear dentries and inodes.
# sync; echo 2 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches

   3. Clear pagecache, dentries, and inodes.
# sync; echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches

   Explanation of the above command.
   sync will flush the file system buffer. Command Separated by ";" run sequentially. The shell waits
   for each command to terminate before executing the next command in the sequence. As mentioned in the
   kernel documentation, writing to drop_cache will clean cache without killing any application/service,
   command echo is doing the job of writing to file.

   If you have to clear the disk cache, the first command is safest in enterprise and production as
   "...echo 1 > ...." will clear the PageCache only. It is not recommended to use the third option above
   "...echo 3 >" in production until you know what you are doing, as it will clear pagecache, dentries,
   and inodes.

Is it a good idea to free Buffer and Cache in Linux that might be used by Linux Kernel?

Free Buffer and Cache in Linux
   When you are applying various settings and want to check, if it is actually implemented specially on
   the I/O-extensive benchmark, then you may need to clear the buffer cache. You can drop cache as
   explained above without rebooting the System i.e., no downtime required.

   Linux is designed in such a way that it looks into the disk cache before looking onto the disk. If it
   finds the resource in the cache, then the request doesn't reach the disk. If we clean the cache, the
   disk cache will be less useful as the OS will look for the resource on the disk.

   Moreover, it will also slow the system for a few seconds while the cache is cleaned and every
   resource required by OS is loaded again in the disk cache.

   Now we will be creating a shell script to auto clear RAM cache daily at 2 am via a cron scheduler
   task. Create a shell script clearcache.sh and add the following lines.
#!/bin/bash
# Note, we are using "echo 3", but it is not recommended in production instead use "echo 1"
echo "echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches"

   Set execute permission on the clearcache.sh file.
# chmod 755 clearcache.sh

   Now you may call the script whenever you are required to clear the ram cache.

   Now set a cron to clear RAM cache every day at 2 am. Open crontab for editing.
# crontab -e

   Append the below line, save and exit to run it at 2 am daily.
0  2  *  *  *  /path/to/clearcache.sh

   Jobs.

Is it a good idea to auto clear the RAM cache on the production server?

Clear RAM Cache on Linux Production Server?
   No! it is not. Think of a situation when you have scheduled the script to clear ram cache every day
   at 2 am. Every day at 2 am the script is executed and it flushes your RAM cache. One day for
   whatsoever reason may be more than expected users are online on your website and seeking resources
   from your server.

   At the same time, the scheduled script runs and clears everything in the cache. Now all the users are
   fetching data from the disk. It will result in a server crash and corrupt the database. So clear
   ram-cache only when required, and known your footsteps, else you are a Cargo Cult System
   Administrator.

How to Clear Swap Space in Linux?
   If you want to clear Swap space, you may like to run the below command.
# swapoff -a && swapon -a

   Also, you may add the above command to a cron script above, after understanding all the associated
   risks.

   Now we will be combining both above commands into one single command to make a proper script to clear
   RAM Cache and Swap Space.
# echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches && swapoff -a && swapon -a && printf '\n%s\n' 'Ram-cache and Swap Cleared'

OR

$ su -c "echo 3 >'/proc/sys/vm/drop_caches' && swapoff -a && swapon -a && printf '\n%s\n' 'Ram-cache and Swap
Cleared'" root

   After testing both the above commands, we will run the command "free -h" before and after running the
   script and will check the cache.
