   How do I allow incoming SSH connections from a specific IP address or subnet on a Ubuntu or Debian
   Linux server using ufw?
   [15]UFW is an acronym for uncomplicated firewall. It is used for managing a Linux firewall and aims
   to provide an easy to use interface for the user. In this tutorial, you will learn how to use UFW a
   frontend to iptables for opening incoming SSH connection on Ubuntu Linux 16.04 LTS or Debian Linux
   server.

Open incoming SSH port for all
   The syntax is:
	sudo ufw allow ssh
   OR
	$ sudo ufw allow 22/tcp
	
   If you are running ssh on TCP port # 2222, enter:
	$ sudo ufw allow 2222/tcp

How to allow incoming SSH from specific IP address

   The syntax is:
	$ sudo ufw allow from {IP_ADDRESS_HERE} to any port 22
	
   To allow incoming SSH connections from a specific IP address named 202.54.1.1, enter:
	$ sudo ufw allow from 202.54.1.1 to any port 22

How to allow incoming SSH from specific subnets

   The syntax is:
	$ sudo ufw allow from {IP_SUB/net} to any port 22
	
   To allow incoming SSH connections from a specific IP subnet named 202.54.1.1/29, enter:
	$ sudo ufw allow from 202.54.1.1/29 to any port 22

Limit incoming SSH port for all
   [17]Open incoming SSH but deny connections from an IP address that has attempted to initiate 6 or
   more connections in the last 30 seconds. The syntax is:
	$ sudo ufw limit ssh
   
   OR
	$ sudo ufw limit 22/tcp

How to check the status of ufw
   The syntax is:
	$ sudo ufw status
   
   Sample outputs:
	Status: active

	To                         Action      From
	--                         ------      ----
	22                         ALLOW       Anywhere
	72.14.190.12 443/tcp       ALLOW       Anywhere
	72.14.190.12 80/tcp        ALLOW       Anywhere

   if ufw was not enabled the output would be:
	sudo ufw status
	Status: inactive

   To turn on UFW on with the default set of rules including open SSH port, enter:
	   $ sudo ufw enable
	   $ sudo ufw status verbose
