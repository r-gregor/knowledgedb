How to Change Your Linux Console Fonts

   font size
   Yes, you can change your Linux console fonts; Carla Schroder shows how.

   I try to be a peaceful soul, but some things make that difficult, like tiny console fonts. Mark my
   words, friends, someday your eyes will be decrepit and you won't be able to read those tiny fonts you
   coded into everything, and then you'll be sorry, and I will laugh.

   Fortunately, Linux fans, you can change your console fonts. As always, the ever-changing Linux
   landscape makes this less than straightforward, and font management on Linux is non-existent, so
   we'll muddle along as best we can. In this article, I'll show what I've found to be the easiest
   approach.

What is the Linux Console?
   Let us first clarify what we're talking about. When I say Linux console, I mean TTY1-6, the virtual
   terminals that you access from your graphical desktop with Ctrl+Alt+F1 through F6. To get back to
   your graphical environment, press Alt+F7. (This is no longer universal, however, and your Linux
   distribution may have it mapped differently. You may have more or fewer TTYs, and your graphical
   session may not be at F7. For example, Fedora puts the default graphical session at F2, and an extra
   one at F1.) I think it is amazingly cool that we can have both X and console sessions running at the
   same time.

   The Linux console is part of the kernel, and does not run in an X session. This is the same console
   you use on headless servers that have no graphical environments. I call the terminals in a graphical
   session X terminals, and terminal emulators is my catch-all name for both console and X terminals.

   But that's not all. The Linux console has come a long way from the early ANSI days, and thanks to the
   Linux framebuffer, it has Unicode and limited graphics support. There are also a number of console
   multimedia applications that we will talk about in a future article.

Console Screenshots
   The easy way to get console screenshots is from inside a virtual machine. Then you can use your
   favorite graphical screen capture program from the host system. You may also make screen captures
   from your console with [42]fbcat or [43]fbgrab. fbcat creates a portable pixmap format (PPM) image;
   this is a highly portable uncompressed image format that should be readable on any operating system,
   and of course you can convert it to whatever format you want. fbgrab is a wrapper script to fbcat
   that creates a PNG file. There are multiple versions of fbgrab written by different people floating
   around. Both have limited options and make only a full-screen capture.

   fbcat needs root permissions, and must redirect to a file. Do not specify a file extension, but only
   the filename:
$ sudo fbcat > Pictures/myfile

   After cropping in GIMP, I get Figure 1.

   It would be nice to have a little padding on the left margin, so if any of you excellent readers know
   how to do this, please tell us in the comments.

   fbgrab has a few more options that you can read about in man fbgrab, such as capturing a different
   console, and time delay. This example makes a screen grab just like fbcat, except you don't have to
   explicitly redirect:
$ sudo fbgrab Pictures/myOtherfile

Finding Fonts
   As far as I know, there is no way to list your installed kernel fonts other than looking in the
   directories they are stored in: /usr/share/consolefonts/ (Debian/etc.), /lib/kbd/consolefonts/
   (Fedora), /usr/share/kbd/consolefonts (openSUSE)...you get the idea.

Changing Fonts
   Readable fonts are not a new concept. Embrace the old! Readability matters. And so does
   configurability, which sometimes gets lost in the rush to the new-shiny.

   On Debian/Ubuntu/etc. systems you can run sudo dpkg-reconfigure console-setup to set your console
   font, then run the setupcon command in your console to activate the changes. setupcon is part of the
   console-setup package. If your Linux distribution doesn't include it, there might be a package for
   you at [46]openSUSE.

   You can also edit /etc/default/console-setup directly. This example sets the Terminus Bold font at 32
   points, which is my favorite, and restricts the width to 80 columns.
ACTIVE_CONSOLES="/dev/tty[1-6]"
CHARMAP="UTF-8"
CODESET="guess"
FONTFACE="TerminusBold"
FONTSIZE="16x32"
SCREEN_WIDTH="80"

   The FONTFACE and FONTSIZE values come from the font's filename, TerminusBold32x16.psf.gz. Yes, you
   have to know to reverse the order for FONTSIZE. Computers are so much fun. Run setupcon to apply the
   new configuration. You can see the whole character set for your active font with showconsolefont.
   Refer to man console-setup for complete options.

Systemd
   Systemd is different from console-setup, and you don't need to install anything, except maybe some
   extra font packages. All you do is edit /etc/vconsole.conf and then reboot. On my Fedora and openSUSE
   systems I had to install some extra Terminus packages to get the larger sizes as the installed fonts
   only went up to 16 points, and I wanted 32. This is the contents of /etc/vconsole.conf on both
   systems:
KEYMAP="us"
FONT="ter-v32b"
