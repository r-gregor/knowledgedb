How to obtain Sunrise & Sunset time for any location from Linux command line

Objective
   The objective is to use command line and bash shell script to obtain Sunrise & Sunset time
   information for any given location.

Operating System and Software Versions
     * Operating System: - Linux distribution agnostic.

Requirements
   Installed lynx tool and access to shell command line. Your location code obtained from
   https://weather.codes/search/.

Conventions
     * # - requires given command to be executed with root privileges either directly as a root user or
       by use of sudo command
     * $ - given command to be executed as a regular non-privileged user

Instructions
   The main motivation for me to get the Sunrise & Sunset times, hence writing this simple script is for
   a home automation. In my case I would like to start certain devices in times when solar power
   generation is adequate for device's power requirements. Given that I have a correct Sunrise & Sunset
   time information and can offset the start end end time with an appropriate number of hours.

Sunrise & Sunset Script
   Create a shell scrip eg. sunrise-sunset.sh with a following content:
    <code>
    #!/bin/bash

    # First obtain a location code from: https://weather.codes/search/

    # Insert your location. For example LOXX0001 is a location code for Bratislava, Slovakia
    location="LOXX0001"

    # Obtain sunrise and sunset raw data from weather.com
    sun_times=$( lynx --dump  https://weather.com/weather/today/l/$location | grep "\* Sun" | sed "s/[[:alpha:]]//
    g;s/*//" )
    # Extract sunrise and sunset times and convert to 24 hour format
    sunrise=$(date --date="`echo $sun_times | awk '{ print }'` AM" +%R)
    sunset=$(date --date="`echo $sun_times | awk '{ print }'` PM" +%R)

    # Use $sunrise and $sunset variables to fit your needs. Example:
    echo "Sunrise for location $location: $sunrise"
    echo "Sunset for location $location: $sunset"
    </code>
    
   Alternatively, you can also clone the latest version from github:
$ git clone https://github.com/linuxconfig/Sunrise-Sunset-Shell-Script.git

   Obtain your location code from https://weather.codes/search/ and assign it to location variable while
   replacing the current example code. Save the file and make it executable:
$ chmod +x sunrise-sunset.sh

Obtain Sunrise & Sunset times
   Make sure that lynx command is available on Linux system or run:
UBUNTU/DEBIAN
# apt install lynx
CENTOS/REDHAT
# yum install lynx

   to install it. All what has left to to run the script:
$ ./sunrise-sunset.sh
Sunrise for location LOXX0001: 06:47
Sunset for location LOXX0001: 18:34
