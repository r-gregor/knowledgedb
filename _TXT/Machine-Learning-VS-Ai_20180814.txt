A common misunderstanding is to conflate the terms ‘machine learning’ and ‘artificial intelligence’.
Machine learning is the use of algorithms that have the ability to learn from a data source, allowing the
algorithm to then create predictions or decisions based on that data. Examples include spam email classification,
housing price prediction, and product recommendations in e-commerce. While machine learning is extremely useful,
we typically don’t think of these single machine-learning algorithms as ‘intelligent’ in the same way we
think of humans as ‘intelligent’. This is why machine learning is a subset of the larger goal of artificial intelligence.
