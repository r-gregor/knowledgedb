How To Find Exact Installation Date And Time Of Your Linux OS

...

What If the logs are deleted already? No problem. You still can find out the installation time of your
Linux OS using the following command as root user:
    fs=$(df / | tail -1 | cut -f1 -d' ') && tune2fs -l $fs | grep created

Or,
    # tune2fs -l /dev/sda1 | grep 'Filesystem created:'
    
Replace /dev/sda1 with correct hdd drive partition.

It will display when the file system was originally created.

Sample output:
    Filesystem created: Thu May 5 18:40:19 2016

These commands will work on all Linux distributions.
