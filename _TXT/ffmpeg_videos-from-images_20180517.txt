Making Videos (that work in Firefox) from a Series of Images (Shallow Thoughts)

Making Videos (that work in Firefox) from a Series of Images
   I was working on a weather project to make animated maps of the jet stream. Getting and plotting wind
   data is a much longer article (coming soon), but once I had all the images plotted, I wanted to
   combine them all into a video showing how the jet stream moves.

   Like most projects, it's simple once you find the right recipe. If your images are named
   outdir/filename00.png, outdir/filename01.png, outdir/filename02.png and so on, you can turn them into
   an MPEG4 video with ffmpeg:
ffmpeg -i outdir/filename%2d.png -filter:v "setpts=6.0*PTS" -pix_fmt yuv420p jetstream.mp4

   %02d, for non-programmers, just means a 2-digit decimal integer with leading zeros, If the filenames
   just use 1, 2, 3, ... 10, 11 without leading zeros, use %2d instead; if they have three digits, use
   %03d or %3d, and so on.

   The -pix_fmt yuv420p turned out to be the tricky part. The recipes I found online didn't include that
   part, but without it, Firefox claims "Video can't be played because the file is corrupt", even though
   most other browsers can play it just fine. If you open Firefox's web console and reload, it offers
   the additional information "Details: mozilla::SupportChecker::AddMediaFormatChecker(const
   mozilla::TrackInfo&)::<lambda()>: Decoder may not have the capability to handle the requested video
   format with YUV444 chroma subsampling.":

   Adding -pix_fmt yuv420p cured the problem and made the video compatible with Firefox, though at first
   I had problems with ffmpeg complaining "height not divisible by 2 (1980x1113)" (even though the
   height of the images was in fact divisible by 2). I'm not sure what was wrong; later ffmpeg stopped
   giving me that error message and converted the video. It may depend on where in the ffmpeg command
   you put the pix_fmt flag or what other flags are present. ffmpeg arguments are a mystery to me.

   Of course, if you're only making something to be uploaded to youtube, the Firefox limitation probably
   doesn't matter and you may not need the -pix_fmt yuv420p argument.

Animated GIFs
   Making an animated GIF is easier. You can use ImageMagick's convert:
convert -delay 30 -loop 0 *.png jetstream.gif

   The GIF will be a lot larger, though. For my initial test of thirty 1000 x 500 images, the MP4 was
   760K while the GIF was 4.2M.
