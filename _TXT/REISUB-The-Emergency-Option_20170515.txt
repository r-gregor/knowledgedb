The Emergency Option: REISUB

All of the above commands can be used in situations when the system is running without any problems.
But what if it crashes? What if the PC or server is hanging, and cannot be rebooted in the agreeable manner?

The answer then is a keyboard combination. If you’ve switched from Windows, you probably know that
Ctrl + Alt + Del displays a menu with Shutdown as an option. If held for longer, the machine will shut down
automatically. On a Mac, meanwhile, you would simply hold down the power button
(an option that also works on Windows hardware).

Windows' strength is customization and it doesn't stop at shutting down. You can end your session or reboot
your system in various ways, many offering more convenience and control than the Start menu.

In Linux, the keyboard combination is Alt + Print Screen + B to reboot. However, if this doesn’t work,
or there is a more complex issue, you can alter the combination, using up to six keys.

This is known as REISUB, due to the following forced acronym:

unRaw — Takes control of the keyboard back from the X display server.
tErminate — Sends the termination signal SIGTERM to all processes, to terminate gracefully.
kIll — As above, but the SIGKILL signal, which forces immediate termination to processes.
Sync — Flushes data to disk.
Unmount — This remounts all filesystems into a read-only state.
reBoot — As you’d expect.

To make this work, you should hold down Alt + Print Screen, then the R E I S U B keys in that order. Leave a
second or two between each keypress. Note that this method doesn’t typically work on machines with ARM
architecture (such as the Raspberry Pi).
