How to Add or Create a New Superuser on Linux

   Granting admin privileges to a new user can be complicated for beginners. Here's how you can easily
   create a new superuser on Linux.
   how to create a new superuser in linux

   On Linux, the sudo command gives you the ultimate privilege to perform various administrative
   functions, despite your non-root access. But to use sudo, you need to have a superuser account on
   your system.

   Since there are several Linux operating systems, more commonly known as distros, there are multiple
   ways to add a sudo user. Read on to find more about how you can use Linux commands within different
   distros to achieve this simple, yet essential task.

Adding a Superuser on Ubuntu and Debian
   Within Ubuntu and other Debian-based distros, there are two prominent ways of adding a sudo user. You
   can either do it through the terminal or take the graphical approach, using System Settings.

1. The Command-Line Approach
   To add a sudo user via the command line, you have to launch the terminal first. Then, type the
   following command:
$> sudo adduser username

   ...where username is the name of the new user that you want to create.

   This command will create a new user that you can add to the sudoers group. Yet again, there are
   multiple ways to add a user to the sudo group. The first way is using the usermod command.
$> sudo usermod -aG sudo username

   ...where -a refers to the Append function and G stands for Group.

   Once you've added the user to the sudo group, you need to check if the aforementioned command worked
   properly. To verify, type the following:
$> groups username

   In case you are a power user, who prefers to avoid multiple commands, you can directly create a new
   superuser using a single command:
$> sudo adduser username sudo

   The verification process remains the same as before.

2. Using the Graphical Interface
   Before adding the user to the sudo group using System Settings, you'll have to create a new user
   first through the command line. Then, follow the steps given below to proceed:
    1. Go to the Applications menu and click on the Users option. You will see a list of users including
       the newly created user(s).
       GUI user add
    2. Click on the Unlock option, followed by the root password. You can switch to another user account
       by simply clicking it.
       Add-user-via-GUI
    3. As soon as you select it, you will see an option to convert the newly created user account into
       an administrator account. Toggle the button next to the Administrator label, and the account will
       get added as a sudo account.


Creating a New Superuser on Arch Linux
   On Arch Linux, since the system doesn't create a sudo account by default, the user has to create one
   manually. The first step is to get root access using the su command.
$> su

   Enter the password for the root user followed by the below command:
$> pacman -Sy sudo

   As soon as sudo is installed, create a new user.
$> useradd --create-home username

   Set up a password for the new user using the passwd command.
$> passwd username

   Now, it is time to add the newly created user name to the sudoers list. Use the usermod command
   to achieve this.
$> usermod --append --groups wheel username

   You can check the sudoers file using the following command:
$> visudo

   Once the /etc/sudoers file opens, you need to edit some user privilege specifications, located at the
   bottom of the sudoers file. Locate the following line in the text file:
#%wheel ALL=(ALL) ALL

   Remove the # symbol preceding the %wheel line and save the changes. Press Ctrl + O on the keyboard to
   save the file.

   To check if the user has been added successfully, you need to execute the following command:
$> su username

   The bash prompt will change to reflect the name of the new user. To verify, type:
$> whoami

   It should display the name of the current user. To check if the new user has sudo privileges, type:
$> sudo whoami

   If the output displays root, then the current user has administrative access.

Adding a sudo Account in CentOS
   Considering CentOS's popularity, it would be a shame to miss out on the process of adding a sudo
   account in this distro. The process for adding a sudo account in CentOS is quite similar to the
   process specified above for Arch Linux, but with a few basic changes.

   Before you create a new user, you have to log in as root. To do so, use the su command:
$> su

   After logging in as the root user, it is time to create a new user, which we will then add to the
   sudoers list.
$> useradd -G wheel username

   Set the password for this new user, using the passwd command.
$> passwd username

   Now, log in as the new user, to check if you have sudo access. To do so, enter the following commands
   one by one:
$> su username
$> sudo whoami

   As soon as you hit enter after typing the first command, the system will prompt you for the password.
   Enter the new password to continue. The output of the above command will display root, which means
   that the current user has root privileges.

How to Add a Superuser in Fedora
   Last but not the least, in case you are using Fedora as your primary OS, you can assign superuser
   privileges to a new user in a few easy steps.

   To create a new user, use the adduser command as follows:
$> adduser username

   Now, set a password for the new user.
$> passwd username

   Add this newly created user to the wheel group using the usermod command.
$> usermod -aG wheel username

   Open the sudoers file using the following command:
$> visudo

   Now, you need to edit some user privilege specifications. Locate the following line in the text file
   and uncomment the %wheel ALL=(ALL) line by removing the Pound character (#) preceding it.
## Uncomment to allow members of group wheel to execute any command
%wheel    ALL=(ALL)    ALL

Granting Superuser Privileges to New Users
   Depending on which distro you are using, the process of creating new sudo users is going to be the
   same more or less, with a few slight differences. The idea is to make sure you are able to grant root
   permissions to any new administrators who will be using the distro.

   Not many Linux users know about this, but sudo and su are two different commands. Although both of
   them perform similar functions, they are very different from one another in many aspects.
   
   Sudo vs. su: Which Command Should You Use?
   On Linux, there are two commands to get superuser access: su and sudo. Which one should you use
   depends on the task at hand.
