How to block an IP address with ufw on Ubuntu Linux server

   I am using UFW to manage firewall on my Ubuntu Linux 12.04/14.04 LTS server. I need to block a
   specific IP address from accessing my server. How do I block an IP address using ufw?
   UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall) is a front-end for iptables and is particularly well-suited for a single
   server or host-based firewalls. It is the default firewall configuration tool for Ubuntu Linux. The
   UFW developed for a new sysadmin with ease use in mind. It is a user-friendly way to create an IPv4
   or IPv6 based firewall to protect the server.

ufw block specific IP address

   The syntax is:
   sudo ufw deny from {ip-address-here} to any
   To block or deny all packets from 192.168.1.5, enter:
   sudo ufw deny from 192.168.1.5 to any

Show firewall status including your rules

   Verify newly added rules, enter:
   $ sudo ufw status numbered
   OR
   $ sudo ufw status

ufw block specific IP and port number

   The syntax is:
   ufw deny from {ip-address-here} to any port {port-number-here}
   To block or deny spammers IP address 202.54.1.5 to port 80, enter:
   sudo ufw deny from 202.54.1.5 to any port 80
   Again verify with the following command:
   $ sudo ufw status numbered
   
   Sample outputs:

Status: active

         To                         Action      From
         --                         ------      ----
[ 1] 192.168.1.10 80/tcp        ALLOW       Anywhere
[ 2] 192.168.1.10 22/tcp        ALLOW       Anywhere
[ 3] Anywhere                   DENY        192.168.1.5
[ 4] 80                         DENY IN     202.54.1.5

ufw deny specific IP, port number, and protocol

   The syntax is:
   sudo ufw deny proto {tcp|udp} from {ip-address-here} to any port {port-number-here}
   For example block hacker IP address 202.54.1.1 to tcp port 22, enter:
   $ sudo ufw deny proto tcp from 202.54.1.1 to any port 22
   $ sudo ufw status numbered

ufw block subnet

   The syntax is same:
   $ sudo ufw deny proto tcp from sub/net to any port 22
   $ sudo ufw deny proto tcp from 202.54.1.0/24 to any port 22

How do I delete blocked IP address or unblock an IP address again?

   The syntax is:
   $ sudo ufw status numbered
   $ sudo ufw delete NUM
   
   To delete rule number # 4, enter:
   $ sudo ufw delete 4
   
   Sample outputs:
Deleting:
 deny from 202.54.1.5 to any port 80
Proceed with operation (y|n)? y
Rule deleted

Tip: UFW NOT blocking an IP address

   UFW (iptables) rules are applied in order of appearance, and the inspection ends immediately when
   there is a match. Therefore, for example, if a rule is allowing access to tcp port 22 (say using sudo
   ufw allow 22
   ), and afterward another Rule is specified blocking an IP address (say using ufw deny proto tcp from
   202.54.1.1 to any port 22), the rule to access port 22 is applied and the later rule to block the
   hacker IP address 202.54.1.1 is not. It is all about the order. To avoid such problem you need to
   edit the /etc/ufw/before.rules file and add a section to "Block an IP Address" after "# End required
   lines" section.
   $ sudo vi /etc/ufw/before.rules
   
   Find line that read as follows:
# End required lines

   Append your rule to block spammers or hackers:

# Block spammers
-A ufw-before-input -s 178.137.80.191 -j DROP
# Block ip/net (subnet)
-A ufw-before-input -s 202.54.1.0/24 -j DROP

   Save and close the file. Finally, reload the firewall:
   $ sudo ufw reload
