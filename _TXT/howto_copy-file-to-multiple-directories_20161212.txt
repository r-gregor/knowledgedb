How to Copy a File to Multiple Directories in Linux

   While learning Linux, it is always the norm for newbies to keep on typing several commands to
   accomplish a simple task. This is understandable especially when one is just getting accustomed to
   using the terminal.

   However, as you look forward to becoming a Linux power user, learning what I would refer to as
   “shortcut commands” can significantly reduce time wasting tendencies.

   In this article, we will explain a easy way, using a single command to copy a file into multiple
   directories in Linux.

   In Linux, the [64]cp command is used to copy files from one directory to another, the easiest syntax
   for using it is as follows:
# cp [options….] source(s) destination

   Alternatively, you can also use the [65]advanced-copy command, which shows a progress bar while
   copying large files/folders in Linux.

   Consider the commands below, normally, you would type two different commands to copy the same file
   into two separate directories as follows:
# cp -v /home/aaronkilik/bin/sys_info.sh /home/aaronkilik/test
# cp -v /home/aaronkilik/bin/sys_info.sh /home/aaronkilik/tmp

   Assuming that you want to copy a particular file into up to five or more directories, this means you
   would have to type five or more cp commands?

   To do away with this problem, you can employ the [68]echo command, a pipe, xargs command together
   with the cp command in the form below:
# echo /home/aaronkilik/test/ /home/aaronkilik/tmp | xargs -n 1 cp -v /home/aaronkilik/bin/sys_info.sh

   In the form above, the paths to the directories (dir1,dir2,dir3…..dirN) are echoed and piped as input
   to the xargs command where:
    1. -n 1 – tells xargs to read one line of input at a time and send to the cp command.
    2. cp – used to copying a file.
    3. -v – enables verbose mode to show details of the copy operation.

   Try to read through the man pages of cp, echo and xargs commands to find useful and advanced usage
   information:
$ man cp
$ man echo
$ man xargs

   That’s all, you can send us questions in relation to the topic or any feedback through the comment
   form below. You may also want to read about the progress command which helps to monitor the
   progress of (cp, mv, dd, tar, etc.) commands that are presently running in Linux.
