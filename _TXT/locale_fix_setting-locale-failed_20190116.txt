Quick Tutorial: How to Fix “Setting locale failed” Issue on Ubuntu
January 14, 2019

   In case you’re running Ubuntu 18.04 ( or earlier versions as well, such as 16.04, 14.04 ), you may be
   encountering a locales warning or error while trying to update your package index or installing a
   package.

   As the locales package configuration states:

     Locales are a framework to switch between multiple languages and allow users to use their
     language, country, characters, collation order, etc.

   The error looks something like this:

   perl: warning: Setting locale failed.
   perl: warning: Please check that your locale settings:
   LANGUAGE = (unset),
   LC_ALL = (unset),
   LC_MONETARY = "de_DE.UTF-8",
   LC_ADDRESS = "de_DE.UTF-8",
   LC_TELEPHONE = "de_DE.UTF-8",
   LC_NAME = "de_DE.UTF-8",
   LC_MEASUREMENT = "de_DE.UTF-8",
   LC_IDENTIFICATION = "de_DE.UTF-8",
   LC_NUMERIC = "de_DE.UTF-8",
   LC_PAPER = "de_DE.UTF-8",
   LANG = "en_US.UTF-8"
       are supported and installed on your system.
   perl: warning: Falling back to a fallback locale ("en_US.UTF-8").
   locale: Cannot set LC_ALL to default locale: No such file or directory

   You may encounter this error very often on a fresh install of Ubuntu or Debian.

   One solution to fix this issue, first run the locale command to list the locales currently defined
   for your user account.
   $ locale

   The output will look something like this:
   
   LANG=en_US.UTF-8
   LANGUAGE=
   LC_CTYPE="de_DE.UTF-8"
   LC_NUMERIC=de_DE.UTF-8
   LC_TIME="de_DE.UTF-8"
   LC_COLLATE="de_DE.UTF-8"
   LC_MONETARY=de_DE.UTF-8
   LC_MESSAGES="de_DE.UTF-8"
   LC_PAPER=de_DE.UTF-8
   LC_NAME=de_DE.UTF-8
   LC_ADDRESS=de_DE.UTF-8
   LC_TELEPHONE=de_DE.UTF-8
   LC_MEASUREMENT=de_DE.UTF-8
   LC_IDENTIFICATION=de_DE.UTF-8
   LC_ALL=

   To generate the missing locale and reconfigure locales, identify the name of your locale ( in my case
   de_DE.UTF-8), or use one another one that you prefer, such as en_US.UTF-8.

   Then generate it using the following command:
   $ sudo locale-gen "de_US.UTF-8"

   And you’ll get the output:

   Generating locales (this might take a while)...
     de_DE.UTF-8... done
   Generation complete.

   After which, reconfigure locales using the following command:
   $ sudo dpkg-reconfigure locales

   And you’ll receive the output:

   Generating locales...
     de_DE.UTF-8... up-to-date
   Generation complete.

   And now you shouldn’t receive any more errors!
