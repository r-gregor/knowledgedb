How to Find and Sort Files Based on Modification Date and Time in Linux

   by [54]Gunjit Khera | Published: January 21, 2016 | Last Updated: January 25, 2016

   Usually, we are in habit of saving a lot of information in form of files on our system. Some, hidden
   files, some kept in a separate folder created for our ease of understanding, while some as it is.
   But, this whole stuff fills our directories; usually desktop, making it look like a mess. But, the
   problem arises when we need to search for a particular file modified on particular date and time in
   this huge collection.

   Find and Sort Files by Date and Time in Linux

   People comfortable with GUI’s can find it using File Manager, which lists files in long listing
   format, making it easy to figure out what we wanted, but those users having habit of black screens,
   or even anyone working on servers which are devoid of GUI’s would want a simple command or set of
   commands that could ease out their search.

   Real beauty of Linux shows here, as Linux has a collection of commands which if used separately or
   together can help to search for a file, or sort a collection of files according to their name, date
   of modification, time of creation, or even any filter you could think of applying to get your result.

   Here, we will unveil the real strength of Linux by examining a set of commands which can help sorting
   a file or even a list of files by Date and Time.

Linux Utilities to Sort Files in Linux

   Some basic Linux command line utilities that are just sufficient for sorting a directory based on
   Date and Time are:

ls command

   ls – Listing contents of directory, this utility can list the files and directories and can even list
   all the status information about them including: date and time of modification or access,
   permissions, size, owner, group etc.

   We’ve already covered many articles on Linux ls command and sort command, you can find them below:
    1. [58]Learn ls Command with 15 Basic Examples
    2. [59]Learn 7 Advance ls Commands with Examples
    3. [60]15 Useful Interview Questions on ls Command in Linux

sort command

   sort – This command can be used to sort the output of any search just by any field or any particular
   column of the field.

   We’ve already covered two articles on Linux sort command, you can find them below:
    1. [61]14 Linux ‘sort’ Command Examples – Part 1
    2. [62]7 Useful Linux ‘sort’ Command Examples – Part 2

   These commands are in themselves very powerful commands to master if you work on black screens and
   have to deal with lots of files, just to get the one you want.

Some Ways to Sort Files using Date and Time

   Below are the list of commands to sort based on Date and Time.

1. List Files Based on Modification Time

   The below command lists files in long listing format, and sorts files based on modification time,
   newest first. To sort in reverse order, use '-r' switch with this command.
# ls -lt

2. List Files Based on Last Access Time

   Listing of files in directory based on last access time, i.e. based on time the file was last
   accessed, not modified.

3. List Files Based on Last Modification Time

   Listing of files in directory based on last modification time of file’s status information, or the
   'ctime'. This command would list that file first whose any status information like: owner, group,
   permissions, size etc has been recently changed.
# ls -ltc

   If '-a' switch is used with above commands, they can list and sort even the hidden files in current
   directory, and '-r' switch lists the output in reverse order.

   For more in-depth sorting, like sorting on Output of find command, however ls can also be used, but
   there 'sort' proves more helpful as the output may not have only file name but any fields desired by
   user.

   Below commands show usage of sort with find command to sort the list of files based on Date and Time.

   To learn more about find command, follow this link: [63]35 Practical Examples of ‘find’ Command in
   Linux

4. Sorting Files based on Month

   Here, we use find command to find all files in root (‘/’) directory and then print the result as:
   Month in which file was accessed and then filename. Of that complete result, here we list out top 11
   entries.
# find / -type f -printf "\n%Ab %p" | head -n 11

Dec /usr/lib/nvidia/pre-install
Dec /usr/lib/libcpufreq.so.0.0.0
Apr /usr/lib/libchromeXvMCPro.so.1.0.0
Apr /usr/lib/libt1.so.5.1.2
Apr /usr/lib/libchromeXvMC.so.1.0.0
Apr /usr/lib/libcdr-0.0.so.0.0.15
Dec /usr/lib/msttcorefonts/update-ms-fonts
Nov /usr/lib/ldscripts/elf32_x86_64.xr
Nov /usr/lib/ldscripts/elf_i386.xbn
Nov /usr/lib/ldscripts/i386linux.xn

   The below command sorts the output using key as first field, specified by '-k1' and then it sorts on
   Month as specified by 'M' ahead of it.
# find / -type f -printf "\n%Ab %p" | head -n 11 | sort -k1M

Apr /usr/lib/libcdr-0.0.so.0.0.15
Apr /usr/lib/libchromeXvMCPro.so.1.0.0
Apr /usr/lib/libchromeXvMC.so.1.0.0
Apr /usr/lib/libt1.so.5.1.2
Nov /usr/lib/ldscripts/elf32_x86_64.xr
Nov /usr/lib/ldscripts/elf_i386.xbn
Nov /usr/lib/ldscripts/i386linux.xn
Dec /usr/lib/libcpufreq.so.0.0.0
Dec /usr/lib/msttcorefonts/update-ms-fonts
Dec /usr/lib/nvidia/pre-install

5. Sort Files Based on Date

   Here, again we use find command to find all the files in root directory, but now we will print the
   result as: last date the file was accessed, last time the file was accessed and then filename. Of
   that we take out top 11 entries.
# find / -type f -printf "\n%AD %AT %p" | head -n 11

12/08/15 11:30:38.0000000000 /usr/lib/nvidia/pre-install
12/07/15 10:34:45.2694776230 /usr/lib/libcpufreq.so.0.0.0
04/11/15 06:08:34.9819910430 /usr/lib/libchromeXvMCPro.so.1.0.0
04/11/15 06:08:34.9939910430 /usr/lib/libt1.so.5.1.2
04/11/15 06:08:35.0099910420 /usr/lib/libchromeXvMC.so.1.0.0
04/11/15 06:08:35.0099910420 /usr/lib/libcdr-0.0.so.0.0.15
12/18/15 11:19:25.2656728990 /usr/lib/msttcorefonts/update-ms-fonts
11/12/15 12:56:34.0000000000 /usr/lib/ldscripts/elf32_x86_64.xr
11/12/15 12:56:34.0000000000 /usr/lib/ldscripts/elf_i386.xbn
11/12/15 12:56:34.0000000000 /usr/lib/ldscripts/i386linux.xn

   The below sort command first sorts on basis of last digit of the year, then sorts on basis of last
   digit of month in reverse order and finally sorts on basis of first field. Here, ‘1.8‘ means 8th
   column of first field and ‘n’ ahead of it means numerical sort, while ‘r’ indicates reverse order
   sorting.
# find / -type f -printf "\n%AD %AT %p" | head -n 11 | sort -k1.8n -k1.1nr -k1

12/07/15 10:34:45.2694776230 /usr/lib/libcpufreq.so.0.0.0
12/08/15 11:30:38.0000000000 /usr/lib/nvidia/pre-install
12/18/15 11:19:25.2656728990 /usr/lib/msttcorefonts/update-ms-fonts

11/12/15 12:56:34.0000000000 /usr/lib/ldscripts/i386linux.xn
04/11/15 06:08:34.9819910430 /usr/lib/libchromeXvMCPro.so.1.0.0
04/11/15 06:08:34.9939910430 /usr/lib/libt1.so.5.1.2
04/11/15 06:08:35.0099910420 /usr/lib/libcdr-0.0.so.0.0.15
04/11/15 06:08:35.0099910420 /usr/lib/libchromeXvMC.so.1.0.0

6. Sorting Files Based on Time

   Here, again we use find command to list out top 11 files in root directory and print the result in
   format: last time file was accessed and then filename.
# find / -type f -printf "\n%AT %p" | head -n 11

11:30:38.0000000000 /usr/lib/nvidia/pre-install
10:34:45.2694776230 /usr/lib/libcpufreq.so.0.0.0
06:08:34.9819910430 /usr/lib/libchromeXvMCPro.so.1.0.0
06:08:34.9939910430 /usr/lib/libt1.so.5.1.2
06:08:35.0099910420 /usr/lib/libchromeXvMC.so.1.0.0
06:08:35.0099910420 /usr/lib/libcdr-0.0.so.0.0.15
11:19:25.2656728990 /usr/lib/msttcorefonts/update-ms-fonts
12:56:34.0000000000 /usr/lib/ldscripts/elf32_x86_64.xr
12:56:34.0000000000 /usr/lib/ldscripts/elf_i386.xbn
12:56:34.0000000000 /usr/lib/ldscripts/i386linux.xn

   The below command sorts the output based on first column of the first field of the output which is
   first digit of hour.
# find / -type f -printf "\n%AT %p" | head -n 11 | sort -k1.1n

06:08:34.9819910430 /usr/lib/libchromeXvMCPro.so.1.0.0
06:08:34.9939910430 /usr/lib/libt1.so.5.1.2
06:08:35.0099910420 /usr/lib/libcdr-0.0.so.0.0.15
06:08:35.0099910420 /usr/lib/libchromeXvMC.so.1.0.0
10:34:45.2694776230 /usr/lib/libcpufreq.so.0.0.0
11:19:25.2656728990 /usr/lib/msttcorefonts/update-ms-fonts

12:56:34.0000000000 /usr/lib/ldscripts/i386linux.xn

7. Sorting Ouptut of ls -l based on Date

   This command sorts the output of 'ls -l' command based on 6th field month wise, then based on 7th
   field which is date, numerically.
# ls -l | sort -k6M -k7n

Conclusion

   Likewise, by having some knowledge of sort command, you can sort almost any listing based on any
   field and even its any column you desire. These were some of tricks to help you sort files based on
   Date or Time. You can have your own tricks build based on these. However, if you have any other
   interesting trick, you can always mention that in your comments.
