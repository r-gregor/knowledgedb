tmux – A Powerful Terminal Multiplexer For Heavy Command-Line Linux User
January 30, 2018

   tmux stands for terminal multiplexer, it allows users to create/enable multiple terminals (vertical &
   horizontal) in single window, this can be accessed and controlled easily from single window when you
   are working with different issues.

   It uses a client-server model, which allows you to share sessions between users, also you can attach
   terminals to a tmux session back. We can easily move or rearrange the virtual console as per the
   need. Terminal sessions can freely rebound from one virtual console to another.

   tmux depends on libevent and ncurses libraries. tmux offers status-line at the bottom of the screen
   which display information about your current tmux session such as current window number, window name,
   username, hostname, current time, and current date.

   When tmux is started it creates a new session with a single window and displays it on screen. It
   allows users to create Any number of windows in the same session.

   Many of us says it’s similar to screen but i’m not since this offers wide range of configuration
   options.

   Make a note: Ctrl+b is the default prefix in tmux so, to perform any action in tumx, you have to type
   the prefix first then required options.
