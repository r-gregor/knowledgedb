How to backup and restore a partition table on Linux
by VIVEK GITE on DECEMBER 30, 2015 last updated DECEMBER 30, 2015

Is it possible to just backup my Linux partition table and restore it when required? How do I restore
partition table if it get deleted by mistake on Linux operating system? How do I backup and restore a GPT
partition table on Linux?

Yes, you need to backup both data and disk's partition table. This is useful for:
 
Replicating disk's partition for Linux software RAID in case of disk failure.

Dealing with corrupted partition table
Dealing with deleted partition table by mistake as data may still exists on the disk and can be accessed again
with a correct partition table.

Warning examples may crash your computerWARNING! These examples may crash your computer if NOT executed with
proper care. BE EXTREMELY CAREFUL WITH THE FOLLOWING COMMANDS. ONE TYPING MISTAKE AND ALL YOUR DATA IS LOST.
How to see my current partition table

Type the following command to list partitions of each device:
# fdisk -l
# fdisk -l /dev/sda

OR
# sfdisk -l
# sfdisk -l /dev/sda

How do I back-up Linux partition with sfdisk command?
To backup /dev/sda partition table, enter:
# sfdisk -d /dev/sda > sda.partition.table.12-30-2015.txt

Copy sda.partition.table.12-30-2015.txt to NFS mounted share or a USB pen drive.

How do I restore the Linux partition with sfdisk command to the disk?
# sfdisk /dev/sda < sda.partition.table.12-30-2015.txt
# sfdisk /dev/sda < /path/to/usb/pen/sda.partition.table.12-30-2015.txt

OR
# sfdisk -f /dev/sda < /media/usb/sda.partition.table.12-30-2015.txt

How do I replicate a disk partition table from /dev/sda to /dev/sdd with the same geometry?
This is useful for Linux based software RAID device. Say you replaced /dev/sdd and you want to rebuild the
Linux software RAID array. The first step is to replicate a partition table from a disk to another disk:
# sfdisk -d /dev/sda | sfdisk -f /dev/sdd

Now, run the following to verify that both hard drives have the same partitioning:
# fdisk -l /dev/sda
# fdisk -l /dev/sdd

Finally, use mdadm to manage and rebuild your RAID device:
# mdadm --manage /dev/mdX --add /dev/sdd1
# mdadm --manage /dev/mdX --add /dev/sdd2
....
..
# mdadm --manage /dev/mdX --add /dev/sddN

Use the following command to see raid array sync progress:
# watch cat /proc/mdstat

A note about disks with GPT (GUID Partition Table)

From the man page:
GPT fdisk (aka gdisk) is a text-mode menu-driven program for creation and manipulation of partition tables.
It will automatically convert an old-style Master Boot Record (MBR) partition table or BSD disklabel stored
without an MBR carrier partition to the newer Globally Unique Identifier (GUID) Partition Table (GPT) format,
or will load a GUID partition table. When used with the -l command-line option, the program displays the
current partition table and then exits.

Let us install gdisk on a Debian or Ubuntu Linux using apt-get command:
$ sudo apt-get install gdisk

RHEL/CentOS user use the yum command to install the same:
# yum install gdisk

Fedora Linux user use the dnf command to install the same:
$ sudo dnf install gdisk

OpenSUSE Linux user use the yast command to install the same:
# yast install gdisk

Please note that sgdisk command works with both Linux and Unix-like system.

How do I backup /dev/sda GPT partition table to a file?
To save partition data to a backup file called /root/sda_partition_table_12_30_2015, run:
# sgdisk --backup={/path/to/file} {/dev/device/here}
# sgdisk --backup=/root/sda_partition_table_12_30_2015 /dev/sda

How do I restore GPT partition table from a file?
To restore the backup use:
# sgdisk --load-backup={/path/to/file} {/dev/device/here}
# sgdisk --load-backup=/media/usb/sda_partition_table_12_30_2015 /dev/sda

How do I replicate GPT partition scheme from /dev/sda to /dev/sdd (RAID array rebuild)?
The syntax is:
# sgdisk -R {SECOND-DEVICE-NAME-HERE} /dev/sda
# sgdisk -R /dev/sdd /dev/sda

To randomize the GUID on the /dev/sdd, enter:
# sgdisk -G /dev/sdd

Finally, verify that both hard drives have the same partitioning schema:
# sgdisk -p /dev/sda
# sgdisk -p /dev/sdd

Finally, use mdadm command as explained earlier to rebuild the RAID array on Linux.
