How To Connect To The Internet Using The Linux Command Line

Introduction
   This guide shows how to connect to the internet via a WI-FI network using the Linux command line.

   If you have installed a headless distribution (I.E, a distribution that doesn’t run a graphical
   desktop) then you won’t have network manager tools to help you connect. It may also be the case that
   you have accidentally deleted key components from your desktop or you have installed a distribution
   that has a bug and the only way to connect to the internet is via the Linux terminal.

   With access to the internet from the Linux command line you can use tools such as [38]wget to
   download web pages and files. You will also be able to [39]download videos using youtube-dl. The
   command line package managers will also be available for your distribution such as [40]apt-get,
   [41]yum and [42]PacMan. With access to package managers you have all you need to install a desktop
   environment should you require one.

Determine Your Wireless Network Interface

   From within the terminal enter the following command:
     iwconfig

   You will see a list of network interfaces.

   The most common wireless network interface is wlan0 but can be other things such as in my case it is
   wlp2s0.

Turn The Wireless Interface On
   The next step is to make sure the wireless interface is turned on.

   Use the following command to do this:
     sudo ifconfig wlan0 up

   Replace the wlan0 with the name of your network interface.

Scan For Wireless Access Points
   Now that your wireless network interface is up and running you can search for networks to connect to.

   Type the following command:
     sudo iwlist scan | more

   A list of available wireless access points will appear.

   The results will look something like this:

	     Cell 02 - Address: 98:E7:F5:B8:58:B1
	     Channel:6
	     Frequency:2.437 GHz (Channel 6)

   It all looks fairly confusing but you only need a couple of bits of information.

   Look at the ESSID. This should be the name of a network which you want to connect to. You can also
   find open networks by looking for items that have the Encryption Key set to off.

   Write down the name of the ESSID that you wish to connect to.

Create A WPA Supplicant Configuration File
   The most common tool used to connect to wireless networks which require a WPA security key is WPA
   Supplicant.

   Most distributions come with this tool pre-installed. You can test this out by typing the following
   into the terminal:
     wpa_passphrase

   If you get an error saying the command cannot be found then it isn’t installed. You are now in a
   chicken and egg scenario whereby you need this tool to connect to the internet but can’t connect to
   the internet because you don’t have this tool. You can of course always use an ethernet connection
   instead to install wpasupplicant.

   To create the configuration file for wpa_supplicant to use run the following command:
     wpa_passphrase ESSID > /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf

   The ESSID will be the ESSID you noted down from the iwlist scan command in the previous section.

   You will notice that the command stops without coming back to the command line. Enter the security
   required for the network and press return.

   To check that the command worked navigate to the .config folder using the [43]cd and [44]tail
   commands:
     cd /etc/wpa_supplicant

   Type the following:
     tail wpa_supplicant.conf

   You should see something like this:
     network={
     ssid="yournetwork"
     #psk="yourpassword"
     psk=388961f3638a28fd6f68sdd1fe41d1c75f0124ad34536a3f0747fe417432d888888
     }

Find The Name Of Your Wireless Driver
   There is one more piece of information you need before connecting to the internet and that is the
   driver for your wireless network card.

   To find this out type in the following command:
   wpa_supplicant –help | more

   This will provide a section called drivers:

   The list will be something like this:
	     drivers:
	     nl80211
	     wext = Linux wireless extensions (generic)
	     wired = Wired Ethernet driver
	     none = no driver (RADIUS server/WPS ER)

   Generally wext is a catchall driver which you can attempt to use if nothing else is available. In my
   case the appropriate driver is the nl80211.

Connect To The Internet
   The first step to getting connected is running the wpa_supplicant command:
     sudo wpa_supplicant -D<nameofdriver> -i<nameofnetworkinterface> -c/etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf -B

   You should replace <nameofdriver> with the driver that you found in the previous section. The
   <nameofnetworkinterface> should be replaced with the network interface discovered in the section
   “Determine Your Network Interface”.

   Basically this command is running wpa_supplicant with the driver specified using the network
   interface specified and the configuration created in the section “Create a WPA Supplicant
   Configuration File”.

   The -B runs the command in the background so you get access to the terminal back.

   Now you need to run this one final command:
     sudo dhclient <nameofnetworkinterface>

   That is it. You should now have an internet connection.

   To test it type the following:
     ping www.google.com
