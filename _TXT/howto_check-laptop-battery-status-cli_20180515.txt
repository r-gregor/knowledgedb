How To Check Laptop Battery Status In Terminal In Linux
Updated May 12, 2018

   Finding your Laptop battery status in GUI mode is easy. You could easily tell the battery level by
   hovering the mouse pointer over the battery indicator icon in the task bar. But, how about from the
   command line? Not everyone know this. The other day a friend of mine asked how to check his Laptop
   battery level from Terminal in his Ubuntu desktop – hence this post. Here I have included three
   simple methods which will help you to check Laptop battery status in Terminal in any Linux
   distribution.

   We can find the Laptop battery status from command line in three methods.

Method 1 – Using “Upower” command
   The Upower command comes preinstalled with most Linux distributions. To display the battery status
   using Upower, open up the Terminal and run:
$ upower -i /org/freedesktop/UPower/devices/battery_BAT0

   Sample output:
native-path: BAT0
 vendor: Samsung SDI
 model: DELL 7XFJJA2
 serial: 4448
 power supply: yes
 updated: Sat 12 May 2018 06:48:48 PM IST (41 seconds ago)
 has history: yes
 has statistics: yes
 battery
 present: yes
 rechargeable: yes
 state: charging
 warning-level: none
 energy: 43.3011 Wh
 energy-empty: 0 Wh
 energy-full: 44.5443 Wh
 energy-full-design: 48.84 Wh
 energy-rate: 9.8679 W
 voltage: 12.548 V
 time to full: 7.6 minutes
 percentage: 97%
 capacity: 91.2045%
 technology: lithium-ion
 icon-name: 'battery-full-charging-symbolic'
 History (charge):
 1526131128 97.000 charging
 History (rate):
 1526131128 9.868 charging

   As you see above, my battery is in charging mode now and the battery level is 97%.

   If the above command doesn’t work for any reason, try the following command instead:
$ upower -i `upower -e | grep 'BAT'`

   Sample output:
native-path: BAT0
 vendor: Samsung SDI
 model: DELL 7XFJJA2
 serial: 4448
 power supply: yes

 has history: yes
 has statistics: yes
 battery
 present: yes
 rechargeable: yes
 state: charging
 warning-level: none
 energy: 43.6119 Wh
 energy-empty: 0 Wh
 energy-full: 44.5443 Wh
 energy-full-design: 48.84 Wh
 energy-rate: 8.88 W
 voltage: 12.552 V
 time to full: 6.3 minutes
 percentage: 97%
 capacity: 91.2045%
 technology: lithium-ion
 icon-name: 'battery-full-charging-symbolic'
 History (rate):
 1526131249 8.880 charging

   Upower not just display the battery status, but also the complete details of the installed battery
   such as model, vendor name, serial no, state, voltage etc.

   However, you can only display the status of the battery by with combination of upower and [54]grep
   commands as shown below.
$ upower -i $(upower -e | grep BAT) | grep --color=never -E "state|to\ full|to\ empty|percentage"

   Sample output:
state: fully-charged
percentage: 100%

   As you see in the above output, my Laptop battery has been fully charged.

   For more details, refer man pages.
$ man upower

Method 2 – Using “acpi” command
   The acpi command shows battery status and other ACPI information in your Linux distribution.

   You might need to install acpi command in some Linux distributions.

   To install acpi on Debian, Ubuntu and its derivatives:
$ sudo apt-get install acpi

   On RHEL, CentOS, Fedora:
$ sudo yum install acpi

   Or,
$ sudo dnf install acpi

   On Arch Linux and its derivatives:
$ sudo pacman -S acpi

   Once acpi installed, run the following command:
$ acpi -V

   Note: Here, “V” is capital letter.

   Sample output:
Battery 0: Charging, 99%, 00:02:09 until charged
Battery 0: design capacity 4400 mAh, last full capacity 4013 mAh = 91%
Battery 1: Discharging, 0%, rate information unavailable
Adapter 0: on-line
Thermal 0: ok, 77.5 degrees C
Thermal 0: trip point 0 switches to mode critical at temperature 84.0 degrees C
Cooling 0: Processor 0 of 3
Cooling 1: Processor 0 of 3
Cooling 2: LCD 0 of 15
Cooling 3: Processor 0 of 3
Cooling 4: Processor 0 of 3
Cooling 5: intel_powerclamp no state information available
Cooling 6: x86_pkg_temp no state information available

   Let us only check the state of the charge of battery. To do so, run:
$ acpi

   Sample output:
Battery 0: Charging, 99%, 00:01:41 until charged
Battery 1: Discharging, 0%, rate information unavailable

   Let us check the battery temperature:
$ acpi -t

   Sample output:
Thermal 0: ok, 63.5 degrees C

   Let us view the above output in Fahrenheit:
$ acpi -t -f

   Sample output:
Thermal 0: ok, 144.5 degrees F

   Want to know whether the AC power is connected or not? Run:
$ acpi -a

   Sample output:
Adapter 0: on-line

   If the AC power is not available, you would the see the following instead:
Adapter 0: off-line

   For more details, check the man pages.
$ man acpi

Method 3: Using “Batstat” Program
   The batstat is a small ncurses-based CLI utility to display your Laptop battery status in Unix-like
   systems. It will display the following details:
     * Current battery level
     * Current Energy
     * Full charge energy
     * Time elapsed from the start of the program, without tracking the sleep time of the machine.
     * Battery level history

   Installing batstat is a piece of cake. Git clone the latest version using command:
$ git clone https://github.com/Juve45/batstat.git

   The above command will pull the latest batstat version and save it’s contents in a folder named
   “batstat”.

   CD to batstat/bin/ directory:
$ cd batstat/bin/

   Copy “batstat” binary file to your PATH, for example /usr/local/bin/.
$ sudo cp batstat /usr/local/bin/

   Make it executable using command:
$ sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/batstat

   Finally, run the following command to view your battery status.
$ batstat

   Sample output:

   As you see in the above screenshot, my battery is in charging mode.

   This utility has some limitations though. As of writing this guide, batstat will support only one
   battery. And, it gathers information only from this folder – “/sys/class/power_supply/”. If your
   machine contains the battery information on a different folder, this program will not work.

   For more details, check batstat github page.
