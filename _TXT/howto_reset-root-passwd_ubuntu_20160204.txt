How to reset the root password on Linux and FreeBSD
Listed below are the step by step procedures to reset the root password in different versions of CentOS,
CoreOS, Debian, Ubuntu and FreeBSD. Begin this procedure by booting your server into single user mode.
If you have direct (physical access) to the server, then just reboot it and proceed with the steps for your
OS below. In case that the server is in a datacenter and only accessible by remote console, begin with
accessing customer portal of your server hosting provider and search for the KVM or server console. The rest
of options are different and dependent on bootloader version in a machine.

one can press any key before machine boot to open the prompt).
