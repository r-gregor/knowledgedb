Linux/Unix:List size of sub and hidden directories

   Posted in [35]Administration by [36]Surendra Anne On August 20, 2015[37]. No comments

   Some times we require to see size of a directory or its sub directories or hidden directories so that
   we can come to know how much size they are occupying on our disk. In this post we will see how to use
   du to get the sizes

   Example1: Find out the size of a folder.

   Note: Do not execute below command on a folder which have many files and folder like / folder because
   it will list all the folders and sub folders with in it, which may go bit deep.
   [INS: :INS]
        du /folder-name

   Example1:
        du /etc/logrotate.d/

   Output:
        surendra@linuxnix:/etc/logrotate.d$ du /etc/logrotate.d/

        76    /etc/logrotate.d/

   Example2: Ok, the above command just show size in bytes, how about showing them in KB, MB or GB etc?
   We can accomplish that with -h option which is for human readable.
        du -h /foldername

   Example:
        surendra@linuxnix:/usr/share$ du -h /usr/share/apache2/

        16K    /usr/share/apache2/default-site

        8.0K    /usr/share/apache2/build

        268K    /usr/share/apache2/icons/small

        1.4M    /usr/share/apache2/icons

        16K    /usr/share/apache2/error/include

        208K    /usr/share/apache2/error

        1.7M    /usr/share/apache2/

   Note: We can use -k option to show file/folder size in KB and -m for MB.

   Example3: If you observe above commands will give you the sizes of each folder and sub folders in
   that given directory. In order to get summerized report we can use -s options
        du -hs /foldername

   Example:
        surendra@linuxnix:/usr/share$ du -hs /usr/share/apache2/

        1.7M    /usr/share/apache2/

   Example4: How to see only just one level below sub directories or folder
        du -hs /foldername/*

   Example:
        surendra@linuxnix:/usr/share$ du -hs /usr/share/apache2/*

        16K    /usr/share/apache2/apache2-maintscript-helper

        4.0K    /usr/share/apache2/ask-for-passphrase

        8.0K    /usr/share/apache2/build

        16K    /usr/share/apache2/default-site

        208K    /usr/share/apache2/error

        1.4M    /usr/share/apache2/icons

   If you observe example4 and example3 outputs you will come to know files size in subdirectories are
   clubbed in to its parent directory.

   Example5: I have hidden directories in my folder, how can I list only hidden folders size
        du -hs .[!.]*

   Let me explain what .[!.]* is all about. In order to understand this you should know . indicates
   present directory and .. indicates parent directory. what .[!.] indicates is my folder starts with .
   and it will not contain . again after the first dot. Which means we are effectively eliminating ..
   which is my parent directory. and .[!.]* is all the hidden files/folder in that given directory.

   Example6: Above example lists only hidden files and directories, how about list all folders/files in
   that directory.
        du -hs .[!.]* *

   Example output:
        8.0K    .thumbnails

        1.4M    .thunderbird

        8.0K    .vim

        28K    .viminfo

        522M    .wine

        4.0K    .Xauthority

        4.0K    .xsession-errors

        4.0K    .xsession-errors.old

        2.0G    10.04_clean_image_for_12.04_16072015

        4.0K    20150430-assets_rcvr.csv

        4.0K    2.4.0-A2 load tests

   Example7: Some times we want to execute this command in many folders which is tedious job, how about
   making this as an alias so that the typing takes less time.
        alias sm="du -hs * | grep -E ^[0-9]+M"

        alias sg="du -hs * | grep -E ^[0-9]+G"

   The first command will list all the folders which are more than or equal to 1M and less than 1000M
   and second command will show all the files/folder which are more than or equal to 1G
        Example:

        surendra@linuxnix:~$ sm

        860M    code

        27M    Music

        26M    Pictures

        579M    ubuntu-14.04.2-server-i386.iso surendra@linuxnix:~$ sg

        16G    Desktop

   In our next post we will see how to free up disk by removing unwanted files.
