How to Add Text to the Beginning of File in Linux
February 8, 2021

   Linux command line users are familiar with the concept of redirection operators, which can write
   output to a file, or read input from a file.

   The operator '>' writes output to a new file, or to an existing file; in which case it wipes off
   everything which is previously present in the file. The operator '>>' on the other hand appends
   output at the end of an existing file. However, there is no dedicated operator to write new text to
   the beginning of a file.

   Today, we will see two ways to add text to the beginning of a file in Linux: one with a workaround,
   and one with a command.
   Note: It is a good approach to first backup the original file and then append the new text to the
   original file. This way if any error occurs while using the commands, we can always restore the
   backup file. Eg. You can simply copy a file called 'file1' to another file called 'file1_bkp' and
   then append the text to the original, i.e. 'file1'.

Add Text to Beginning of File Using echo and cat Commands
   As you might know, the echo command prints whatever is passed as the argument to the output,
   whereas the cat command prints the contents of a file to the output.

   We can thus pass the new text to be added to echo, pass the file to a cat, combine and write the
   output to the file. This can be done as follows:
$> x=$(echo "New Text"; cat filename)
$> echo "$x" > filename

   Basically, we are combining the new text and existing contents of the file, and storing the new
   contents in a variable. Then, we simply output the variable and redirect it to the same file.
$> cat samplefile.txt
$> x=$(echo "Name: John"; cat samplefile.txt)
$> cat samplefile.txt

   Redirect Variable to File Redirect Variable to File

   As you can see above, the new text was added on a new line at the beginning of the file. To add the
   text at the beginning of the existing first line, use the -n argument of echo.
$> x=$(echo -n "New Text"; cat filename)
$> echo "$x" > filename

   Note that although Bash or many other shells do not have a limit on the size of a variable, however,
   the size may be limited based on the environment and system configuration. Hence there might be a
   scenario when 'samplefile.txt' is a file containing a humongous amount of data, and the variable
   fails to store all of it.

Add Text to First Line of File Using sed Command
   sed (short for 'Stream Editor') is a command-line editor in Linux, that is used to perform operations
   like writing text to a file, find and replace, etc.

   sed is a complex command with a lot of options to edit files in various ways. We will be using
   particular features of sed to add text to the beginning of a file.

   Run the following to insert text on a new line at the beginning.
$> sed -i '1i New Text' filename

   The -i argument tells sed to modify the file itself. Without it, sed automatically creates a copy of
   the file and performs all modifications on the copy.

   The string '1i New Text' means: 'insert' the string 'New Text' on the '1st' line.
$> cat samplefile.txt
$> sed -i '1i Introduction' samplefile.txt
$> $ cat samplefile.txt

   Insert Text New Line at Beginning of File Insert Text New Line at Beginning of File

   Again, this is adding the new content on a new line at the beginning. To add new text on the existing
   line, run:
$> sed -i '1s/^/New Text/' filename

   Basically, the exponent symbol ('^') signifies a null string. The '1' at the beginning signifies that
   sed should consider the null string at beginning of line 1 and the 's' is a sed command, to replace a
   string. Here, the null string is replaced by 'New Text'.
$> cat samplefile.txt
$> sed -i '1s/^/Person/' samplefile.txt
$> cat samplefile.txt

   Insert Text to Exsiting Line in File Insert Text to Existing Line in File

Conclusion
   We learned two simple yet catchy ways to add new text to the beginning of a file in Linux. Of course,
   the obvious way to do this, if it is to be done manually, is to modify the file with a file editor.
   However, in a script, the methods discussed here can be used.
