Use the convert program to convert between image formats as well as resize an image, blur, crop, despeckle,
dither, draw on, flip, join, re-sample, and much more. See Command Line Processing for advice on how to
structure your convert command or see below for example usages of the command.

We list a few examples of the convert command here to illustrate its usefulness and ease of use. To get
started, lets convert an image in the JPEG format to PNG:

magick convert rose.jpg rose.png

Next, we reduce the image size before it is written to the PNG format:

magick convert rose.jpg -resize 50% rose.png

You can combine multiple image-processing operations to produce complex results:

magick convert -size 320x85 canvas:none -font Bookman-DemiItalic -pointsize 72 \
  -draw "text 25,60 \'Magick\'" -channel RGBA -blur 0x6 -fill darkred -stroke magenta \
  -draw "text 20,55 \'Magick\'" fuzzy-magick.png

or here we resize an image with improved quality:

magick convert input.png -colorspace RGB +sigmoidal-contrast 11.6933 \
  -define filter:filter=Sinc -define filter:window=Jinc -define filter:lobes=3 \
  -resize 400% -sigmoidal-contrast 11.6933 -colorspace sRGB output.png');

You can find additional examples of using convert in Examples of ImageMagick Usage.
