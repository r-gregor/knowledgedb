[31]ffmpeg - h264 to xvid creates large file

   up vote 2 down vote [32]favorite

   I'm trying to use ffmpeg to convert a h264/aac video file to an xvid/mp3 file so I can play it in my
   ultra-cheap media player.

   At the moment the converted video file is TWICE the size of the original mp4. Is there any way to get
   a smaller file size without loosing too much quality? Even a drop to -qmin 1 is pretty awful!

   The command i'm using is
ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vcodec libxvid -sameq -acodec libmp3lame -ab 128k -ac 2 output.avi

   And the ffmpeg output is
  Input #0, mov,mp4,m4a,3gp,3g2,mj2, from 'input.mp4'

     xvid isn't as good at compression as h264. What did you expect? – [39]phogg Dec 30 '10 at 17:23

     try using the two pass parameter – [40]RobotHumans Dec 30 '10 at 17:27

   Depending on what your media player can handle, you can reduce the frame size, e.g. if it starts as
   1280x720, decrease to 640x360. That would let you reduce the video bitrate by 3/4 without changing
   the quality, and smaller video players only display 640 pixels wide anyway.

   As has been said before in comments, h.264 is a better (as in compresses better) codec than xvid, so
   with all other things being equal (quality, framesize, framerate etc.) xvid will always produce
   larger files. the upside to xvid is that it's less CPU intensive than h.264 which is why cheap media
   players can use it.

   Case in point, XBMC on the original xbox (which had a CPU of PIII architecture running at 733 MHz)
   could be coerced into playing 720p HD content, but only if the codec was lightweight enough and with
   very specific flags. this was typically xvid as h.264 even in SD resolutions was usually too much for
   the poor old PIII. at SD resolutions a typical acceptable Q 45 min tv show weighs in around 350 Mb,
   but in h.264 would be around half that.

   for your best bet, re-code the videos to the same res as the device (but keeping the quality), that
   way you're not wasting any bandwidth on image that's only going to be downscaled at playback time
   anyway. - halving the resolution in any direction (say 1280x720 -> 640x360 as mentioned above) will
   reduce the required bandwidth (and resulting filesize) to 1/4.
