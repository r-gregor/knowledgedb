How to Get Domain and IP Address Information Using WHOIS Command
January 2, 2018

   WHOIS is a TCP-based query and response protocol that is commonly used to provide information
   services to Internet users. It returns information about the registered Domain Names, an IP address
   block, Name Servers and a much wider range of information services.

   In Linux, the whois command line utility is a WHOIS client for communicating with the WHOIS server
   (or database host) which listen to requests on the well-known port number 43, which stores and
   delivers database content in a human-readable format.
