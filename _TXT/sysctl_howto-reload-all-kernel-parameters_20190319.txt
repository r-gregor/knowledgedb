how to reload all kernel parameters in linux?
Monday, March 18, 2019

   You need to use the sysctl command which is used to modify kernel parameters at run time.
   The parameters available are those listed under /proc/sys/.
   
   Procfs is required for sysctl support in Linux. You can use sysctl command to both read and write
   sysctl variables.
   
   Display Linux kernel parameters
   Display all sysctl variables
   The syntax is:
   # sysctl variable
   # sysctl -a
   # sysctl -a | more
   
   Sample output
   vm.swappiness = 60
   vm.user_reserve_kbytes = 131072
   vm.vfs_cache_pressure = 100
   
   To see value for kernel variable called kernel.hostname, enter:
   # sysctl -n kernel.hostname
   
   How do I set new values?
   There are three methods to set new values for given kernel parameters as follows:
   
   Method # 1: Setting value via procfs
   You can use standard echo command to write data to variables (this temporary change):
   # echo "value" > /proc/sys/location/variable
   Echo “1” > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/all/rp_filter
   
   Method # 2: Temporary on the command line
   Use sysctl command with -w option when you want to change a sysctl setting:
   sysctl -w variable=value
   
   To enable packet forwarding for IPv4, enter:
   # sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
   Method # 3: Configuration file /etc/sysctl.conf
   
   This is recommended way. First open /etc/sysctl.conf file, enter:
   # vi /etc/sysctl.conf
   Now add value:
   variable = value
   
   example :
   net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
   
   Close and save the changes. Type the following command to load sysctl settings from the file
   /etc/sysctl.conf file:
   # sysctl -p
   
   OR
   # sysctl -p /etc/sysctl.conf
   
   The last method will load settings permanently at boot time from /etc/sysctl.conf file. Read man page
   of sysctl for information:
   $ man sysctl
   
   Reload settings from all system configuration files
   Type the following command to reload settings from config files without rebooting the box:
   # sysctl --system
   
   For older versions (that is, if --system does not work):
   # Load settings from /etc/sysctl.conf
   sysctl -p
   
   The settings are read from all of the following system configuration files:
   /run/sysctl.d/*.conf
   /etc/sysctl.d/*.conf
   /usr/local/lib/sysctl.d/*.conf
   /usr/lib/sysctl.d/*.conf
   /lib/sysctl.d/*.conf
   /etc/sysctl.conf
   # Load settings from the specified file
   sysctl -p /etc/sysctl.d/<whatever>.conf
   
   example:
   sysctl -p /etc/sysct.d/10-magic-sysrq.conf
