Test If Linux Server SCSI / SATA Hard Disk Going Bad
last updated June 2, 2017

   One of our regular reader sends us a question:
      How can I test if my hard disk is going bad? I see few errors in /var/log/messages file.
   I/O errors in /var/log/messages indicates that something is wrong with the hard disk and it may be
   failing. You can check hard disk for errors using smartctl command, which is control and monitor
   utility for SMART disks under Linux / UNIX like operating systems.
   [29]smartctl controls the Self-Monitoring, Analysis and Reporting Technology (SMART) system built
   into many ATA-3 and later ATA, IDE and SCSI-3 hard drives. The purpose of SMART is to monitor the
   reliability of the hard drive and predict drive failures, and to carry out different types of drive
   self-tests.

smartctl for servers
   smartctl is a command line utility designed to perform SMART tasks such as printing the SMART
   self-test and error logs, enabling and disabling SMART automatic testing, and initiating device
   self-tests. First, make sure S.M.A.R.T. support is enabled in the BIOS. Next, run the following
   command to see if your hard disks support S.M.A.R.T technology or not:
   # smartctl -i /dev/sdb
   To enable SMART, run:
   # smartctl -s on -d ata /dev/sdb

A note about RAID controller

   To look at ATA disks behind 3ware SCSI RAID controllers, the syntax is:
   # smartctl -a -d 3ware,2 /dev/sda
   # smartctl -a -d 3ware,0 /dev/twe0
   See how to use the smartctl command to check disk behind [30]Adaptec RAID controllers and [31]hard
   disk behind 3Ware RAID cards for more information.

Task: Extended self-test of drive

   You need to begin an extended self-test of drive /dev/hdc. You can issue this command on a running
   system. The results can be seen in the self-test log visible with the ‘-l selftest’ option after it
   has completed:
   # smartctl -d ata -t long /dev/sdb

Sample failing hard Disk detailed report

   # smartctl -a /dev/sda

   If you see Reallocated or Pending sectors, replace that drive ASAP.

Restore From Backup
   If any one of these test reports error, replace the hard disk and [32]restore the data from backups.

Configure smartd on server to get email based warnings if problems are detected
   smartd is a daemon that monitors hard disk and it will attempt to enable SMART monitoring on hard
   disks. It polls hard disk health data and SCSI devices every 30 minutes (configurable option). It
   logs SMART errors and changes of SMART Attributes via the SYSLOG interface. The default location for
   these SYSLOG notifications and warnings is system-dependent (typically /var/log/messages or
   /var/log/syslog). In addition to logging to a file, smartd can also be configured to send email
   warnings if problems are detected. Depending upon the type of problem, you may want to run self-tests
   on the disk, back up the disk, replace the disk, or use a manufacturer’s utility to force
   reallocation of bad or unreadable disk sectors. See how to [33]install and configure smartd for more
   information.

Gnome disk utility
   Most Linux and Unix like oses such as FreeBSD or OpenBSD comes with a gui tool called Disk Utility.
   This will only work, if you are running gnome based desktop or laptop system. To start Disk utility
   visit:
   Applications > System Tools > Disk Utility
   Click on the hard disk:

Say hello to GSmartControl
   GSmartControl is hard disk drive health inspection tool and a graphical user interface for smartctl
   command. This tool has the following features:
    1. Automatically reports and highlights any anomalies;
    2. Allows enabling/disabling SMART;
    3. Allows enabling/disabling Automatic Offline Data Collection – a short self-check that the drive
       will perform automatically every four hours with no impact on performance;
    4. Supports configuration of global and per-drive options for smartctl;
    5. Performs SMART self-tests;
    6. Displays drive identity information, capabilities, attributes, and self-test/error logs;
    7. Can read in smartctl output from a saved file, interpreting it as a read-only virtual device;
    8. Works on most smartctl-supported operating systems like *BSD and various Linux distros;
    9. Has extensive help information.

   You can install it as follows on Debian or Ubuntu based systems using the [34]apt-get command:
   $ sudo apt-get install gsmartcontrol
   On Fedora or RHEL or CentOS Linux use the yum command as follows to install the same:
   # yum install gsmartcontrol
