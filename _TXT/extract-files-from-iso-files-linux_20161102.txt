3 Ways to Extract and Copy Files from ISO Image in Linux

   Let’s say you have a large ISO file on your Linux server and you wanted to access, extract or copy
   one single file from it. How do you do it? Well in Linux there are couple ways do it.

   For example, you can use standard mount command to mount an ISO image in read-only mode using the
   loop device and then copy the files to another directory.

Mount or Extract ISO File in Linux
   To do so, you must have an ISO file (I used ubuntu-16.10-server-amd64.iso ISO image) and mount point
   directory to mount or extract ISO files.

   First create an mount point directory, where you will going to mount the image as shown:
$ sudo mkdir /mnt/iso

   Once directory has been created, you can easily mount ubuntu-16.10-server-amd64.iso file and verify
   its content by running following command.
$ sudo mount -o loop ubuntu-16.10-server-amd64.iso /mnt/iso
$ ls /mnt/iso/

   Now you can go inside the mounted directory (/mnt/iso) and access the files or copy the files to /tmp
   directory using [64]cp command.
$ cd /mnt/iso
$ sudo cp md5sum.txt /tmp/
$ sudo cp -r ubuntu /tmp/

   Note: The -r option used to copy directories recursively, if you want you can also [66]monitor
   progress of copy command.

Extract ISO Content Using 7zip Command
   If you don’t want to mount ISO file, you can simply install 7zip, is an open source archive program
   used to pack or unpack different number of formats including TAR, XZ, GZIP, ZIP, BZIP2, etc..
$ sudo apt-get install p7zip-full p7zip-rar [On Debian/Ubuntu systems]
$ sudo yum install p7zip p7zip-plugins      [On CentOS/RHEL systems]

   Once 7zip program has been installed, you can use 7z command to extract ISO file contents.
$ 7z x ubuntu-16.10-server-amd64.iso

   Note: As compared to Linux mount command, 7zip seems much faster and smart enough to pack or unpack
   any archive formats.

Extract ISO Content Using isoinfo Command
   The isoinfo command is used for directory listings of iso9660 images, but you can also use this
   program to extract files.

   As I said isoinfo program perform directory listing, so first list the content of ISO file.
$ isoinfo -i ubuntu-16.10-server-amd64.iso -l

   Now you can extract a single file from an ISO image like so:
$ isoinfo -i ubuntu-16.10-server-amd64.iso -x MD5SUM.TXT > MD5SUM.TXT

   Note: The redirection is needed as -x option extracts to stdout.
