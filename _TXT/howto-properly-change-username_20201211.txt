How To Properly Change Username In Linux
December 5, 2020

   This brief guide explains how to properly change username in Linux operating system. Not just the
   username, this guide also describes how to change the hostname, user group, home directory and the
   ownership and group of that directory to the new user, along with all files.

   A few days ago, I downloaded the Fedora 33 vagrant box and deployed it using libvirt/kvm
   provider. As you might already know, all vagrant boxes comes with a default user called "vagrant".
   And the default hostname for the vagrant box is localhost. I changed the username and hostname in the
   Fedora VM for better accessibility in the network. If you're ever looking for a proper way to change
   the username in Linux without messing the existing configuration files, here is how.

   A note of caution:
   I would not recommend this in production environment. It is always best to just create a new user
   rather than renaming the existing one. Because renaming username will cause so many problems if the
   old user's home directory is referenced by some other configuration files. You may end up changing
   the config files used by so many services. Also do not do it if your $HOME directory is encrypted!.
   So I recommend you to create a new user and move the old user's data to new one. If it is a freshly
   installed system or just testing system, you can then go ahead and change the user name as described
   below.

The right way to change username in Linux
   Changing hostname in Fedora and other Linux distributions is easy!

   Login as a different sudo user or root user. Because you can't change the username of the currently
   logged in user. I logged in as root user.

   Change the current hostname using the hostnamectl command like below:
# hostnamectl set-hostname fedora33

   The above command changes the old hostname to "fedora33". Log out and log back in to apply the
   changes. You will now see that the hostname is updated in the shell prompt. You can also check it
   using hostname command:
# hostname
fedora33

   Here comes the main part. Now I am going to change the user name from "vagrant" to "ostechnix". To do
   so, I created a new group called "ostechnix" using command:
# groupadd ostechnix

   For the purpose of this guide, I used the same name for user and group. You can use different name if
   you want.

   And then changed the username using the usermod command like below:
# usermod -d /home/ostechnix -m -g ostechnix -l ostechnix vagrant

   Let us break down the above command and see what each option does.
     * usermod : The command to modify a user account in Unix-like systems.
     * -d /home/ostechnix : Create a new $HOME directory for the user.
     * -m : Move the content of the old user's $HOME directory to the new location.
     * -g ostechnix : Add the new user to a group called "ostechnix".
     * -l ostechnix vagrant : Change the name of the user from "vagrant" to "ostechnix". i.e. "vagrant"
       is the old user name and "ostechnix" is the new user.

   The above command changes the user name, the user group, the $HOME directory and ownership and group
   of that directory to the new user, along with all the user's files and directories.

   Finally, assign sudo privileges to the new user using command:
# usermod -aG wheel ostechnix

   If you're on Debian-based systems like Ubuntu, you can grant sudo permissions to the user using
   this command:
$ sudo usermod -aG sudo ostechnix

   Now exit it from the root user and log in as new user.

   Verify if the hostname, username, and $HOME directories are changed:
   Check username and hostname in Fedora Check username and hostname in Fedora Check username and
   hostname in Fedora

   Great! Everything is changed as I wished.

   For more details about usermod command, refer its man page:
$ man usermod
