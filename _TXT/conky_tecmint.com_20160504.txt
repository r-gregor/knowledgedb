   Conky can be installed from repo as well as, can be compiled from source.
# yum install conky              [On RedHat systems]
# apt-get install conky-all      [On Debian systems]

   Note: Before you install conky on Fedora/CentOS, you must have enabled [60]EPEL repository.

   After conky has been installed, just issue following command to start it.
$ conky &

   It will run conky in a popup like window. It uses the basic conky configuration file located at
   /etc/conky/conky.conf.

   You may need to integrate conky with the desktop and won’t like a popup like window every-time. Here
   is what you need to do

   Copy the configuration file /etc/conky/conky.conf to your home directory and rename it as ‘.conkyrc‘.
   The dot (.) at the beginning ensures that the configuration file is hidden.
$ cp /etc/conky/conky.conf /home/$USER/.conkyrc

   Now restart conky to take new changes.
$ killall -SIGUSR1 conky

   You may edit the conky configuration file located in your home dircetory. The configuration file is
   very easy to understand.

   Here is a sample configuration of conky.

   Conky Configuration

   From the above window you can modify color, borders, size, scale, background, alignment and several
   other properties. By setting different alignments to different conky window, we can run more than one
   conky script at a time.

Using script other than the default for conky and where to find it?

   You may write your own conky script or use one that is available over Internet. We don’t suggest you
   to use any script you find on the web which can be potentially dangerous unless you know what you are
   doing. However a few famous threads and pages have conky script that you can trust as mentioned
   below.

   http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=281865
   http://conky.sourceforge.net/screenshots.html

   At the above url, you will find every screenshot has a hyperlink, which will redirects to script
   file.

Testing Conky Script

   Here I will be running a third party written conky-script on my Debian Jessie Machine, to test.
$ wget https://github.com/alexbel/conky/archive/master.zip
$ unzip master.zip

   Change current working directory to just extracted directory.
$ cd conky-master

   Rename the secrets.yml.example to secrets.yml.
$ mv secrets.yml.example secrets.yml

   Install Ruby before you could run this (ruby) script.
$ sudo apt-get install ruby
$ ruby starter.rb

   Note: This script can be modified to show your current weather, temperature, etc.

   If you want to start conky at boot, add the below one liner to startup Applications.
conky --pause 10
save and exit.

   And Finally…such a lightweight and useful GUI eye candy like package is not in active stage and is
   not maintained officially anymore. The last stable release was conky 1.9.0 released on May 03, 2012.
   A thread on Ubuntu forum has gone over 2k pages of users sharing configuration. (link to forum :
