   The Cult of DD
   Mar 17, 2017

   You’ll often see instructions for creating and using disk images on Unix systems making use of the dd
   command. This is a strange program of [3]obscure provenance that somehow, still manages to survive in
   the 21st century.

   Actually, using dd is almost never necessary, and due to its highly nonstandard syntax is usually
   just an easy way to mess things up. For instance, you’ll see [4]instructions like this asking you to
   run commands like:
# Obscure dd version
dd if=image.iso of=/dev/sdb bs=4M

   Guess what? This is exactly equivalent to a regular shell pipeline using cat and shell redirection:
# Equivalent cat version
cat image.iso >/dev/sdb

   That weird bs=4M argument in the dd version isn’t actually doing anything special—all it’s doing is
   instructing the dd command to use a 4 MB buffer size while copying. But who cares? Why not just let
   the command figure out the right buffer size automatically?

   Another reason to prefer the cat variant is that it lets you actually string together a normal shell
   pipeline. For instance, if you want progress information with cat you can combine it with the pv
   command:
# Cat version with progress meter
cat image.iso | pv >/dev/sdb

   There’s an obscure option to GNU dd to get it to display a progress meter as well. But why bother
   memorizing that? If you learn the pv trick once, you can use it with any program.

   If you want to create a file of a certain size, you can do so using other standard programs like
   head. For instance, here are two ways to create a 100 MB file containing all zeroes:
# Obscure dd version
dd if=/dev/zero of=image.iso bs=4MB count=25

# Regular head version
head -c 100MB /dev/zero >image.iso

   The head command is useful for lots of things, not just creating disk images. Therefore it’s a better
   investment of your time to learn head than it is to learn dd. In fact, you probably already know how
   to use it.

   I will confess: there are some interesting options that dd has, which aren’t easily replicated with
   cat or head. For instance, you can use dd to convert a file between ASCII and [5]EBCDIC encodings. So
   if you find yourself doing that a lot, I won’t blame you for reaching for dd. But otherwise, try to
   stick to more standard Unix tools.
