How To Find The Oldest File In A Directory Tree In Linux
   Published April 10, 2017 · Updated April 10, 2017
   
   Today, a fellow Linux user asked me how to find the oldest file in a directory from command line in
   Linux. We could tell the oldest file in a directory by using the date and time stamps in GUI mode. I
   don’t even know how to do find it from the command line. Fortunately, I found [63]this solution after
   a bit of digging in Google. If you ever wondered how to find the oldest file in a directory or or the
   entire file system, read on. It is not that difficult.

Find The Oldest File In A Directory Tree In Linux
   To find the oldest file in a directory, for example /home/sk/ostechnix/, run:
find /home/sk/ostechnix/ -type f -printf '%T+ %p\n' | sort | head -n 1

   Let us break down this command and see what each command line argument does.

   Here,
     * find – Search for files in a directory hierarchy
     * /home/sk/ostechnix/ – Search location
     * type -f – Searches only the regular files.
     * -printf ‘%T+ %p\n’ – Prints the file’s last modification date and time in separated by + symbol.
       (Eg. 2015-07-22+13:42:40.0000000000). Here, %p indicates the file name. \n indicates new line.
     * sort | head -n 1 – The sort command sorts the output and sends the output to head command to
       display the oldest file. Here, -n 1 indicates only one file i.e oldest file file.

   As you might already know, [64]Explainshell helps you to find what each part of a Linux command does.

   The Sample output for the above command would be:
2015-07-22+13:42:40.0000000000 /home/sk/ostechnix/Absolute FreeBSD_ 2nd Edition.pdf

   As you see in the above output, Absolute FreeBSD_ 2nd Edition.pdf is the oldest file in
   /home/sk/ostechnix/ directory. Please note that Linux doesn’t find the oldest file by using the file
   creation date. Instead, it uses the file modification date to find it.

   Likewise, to find the top five oldest files in a given directory, just run:
find /home/sk/ostechnix/ -type f -printf '%T+ %p\n' | sort | head -n 5

   Sample output:
2015-07-22+13:42:40.0000000000 /home/sk/ostechnix/Absolute FreeBSD_ 2nd Edition.pdf
2016-11-28+21:03:05.0000000000 /home/sk/ostechnix/Etcher-linux-x64.AppImage
2016-12-14+18:28:20.5162190000 /home/sk/ostechnix/ubuntu.jpg
2016-12-18+18:14:46.5931480000 /home/sk/ostechnix/Marconi Union - Sleepless.mp3
2017-03-17+19:28:27.8193330000 /home/sk/ostechnix/The Devops toolkit.pdf

   The oldest file will be displayed first.

   To find the oldest file in the root (/) file system, run:
find / -type f -printf '%T+ %p\n' | sort | head -n 1

   That’s it. You know now how to find the oldest file in a given directory tree in Unix-like operating
   systems. I will be soon here with another interesting guide soon. If you find this helpful, please
