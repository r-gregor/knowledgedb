How do I remove some sessions from the session list in Xubuntu

   When logging in to Xubuntu, I get a selection list of saved sessions, most of them is outdated old
   stuff.

   I hit the delete button in a sportive manner. I tried a click to the left, and just a click to the
   right - no deletion possible.

   I went through system menus and menu sections (and the system section of the menu).

   Note: Not related: How to remove session entries from LightDM? or Managing the login screen's
   sessions list which links to it - they handle session-classes like xubuntu vs. xfce, gnome, kde - not
   different xfce-sessions.

***
   Go to $HOME/.cache/sessions and open the latest file with the name xfce-session-yourdesktopname in a
   text editor.

   All your sessions are listed in the file by name in this format:
[Session: Default]

   or
[Session:somename]

   Select the entire set of lines from [Session:somename] to the next blank line (including the
   [Session:somename] line and delete them. Save the file.

   The place, where to look in Xfce is indeed
$HOME/.cache/sessions

   I found a lot of files there, including some empty Thunar- files, xfwm4- files and, interesting for
   us, xfce4-session-asux:0, where asux is the name of my local machine, the hostname.

   :0 reminds of the way, the XServer enumerates different instances, which I used rarely, but I used
   it, so I have a xfce4-session-asux:1 file as well, and it is rather old, but different sessions
   aren't stored in different files, but in different sections inside the file.

   Such a section looks like this:
[Session: 2010]
key1=value1
key2=value2
...
LastAccess=1315125649

   So you can see the name ("2010" in this case) of the session, a bunch of key-value-pairs, and as last
   these pairs a LastAccess key. It stores the seconds since 1.1.1970 UTC. It's not short and easy to
   translate it to a human readable date with date or bash arithmetic (or tell me how in the comments).
   But at least the age in years is worth calculating:
echo $((1315125649/(365*24*60*60)))

   So it is 41 years after 1.1.1970 (ignoring leap years and daylight saving time, and cutting the
   result to whole years) which is 2011. The other fields can be computed as well - I prefered to do it
   with scala by
scala> val d = new java.util.Date (1315125649*1000L)
d: java.util.Date = Sun Sep 04 10:40:49 CEST 2011

   So I remove the whole section, and after relogin, this session is vanished from my list of sessions.

update:

   I now know the much simpler solution for the date issue, simply put into the shell:
date -d @1315125649
So 4. Sep 10:40:49 CEST 2011

   So this can be made into a simple script:
for f in  ~/.cache/sessions/xfce4-session-*
do
   la=$(sed -n -r 's/LastAccess=(.*)/\1/p' "$f")
   echo -e $(date -d @$la) "\t$f"
done

   AFAIK most of the display managers handle sessions from .desktop files present in
   /usr/share/xsessions. I guess renaming it to something else will remove session entries.

   E.g.
cd /usr/share/xsessions
mv gnome.desktop gnome.desktop.backup

   xfce caches its session in $HOME/.cache/sessions as well as has configurations in
   $HOME/.config/xfce4-session. You could try viewing those folders as well. I think xubuntu has folders
   with names xubuntu in place of xfce as it has its own session manager.

     * As I expected, only root has write access to /usr/share/xsession and its subfolders.
       gnome.desktop is of course completly off topic. $HOME/.cache/sessions seems the right thing:
       older and younger entries, xfce4-session-* and xfwm4-*-files are laying around. After renaming
       them and relogin (which might take some time) you might get the "accepted" flag, but the
       /usr/share part should really be removed. The $HOME/.config/xfce4-session directory only contains
       a 2 and a 4 years old file - this seems to be unrelated too.

***
   This is how it goes:
     * Click on Settings manager at the app menu or run xfce4-settings-manager from a terminal
     * Click on 'Session and Startup'
     * Uncheck 'Display chooser on login' on the general tab, 'Session Chooser'
     * Also review the 'Logout Settings' on the same tab.
     * *In session tab, Click 'Clear saved session' *
