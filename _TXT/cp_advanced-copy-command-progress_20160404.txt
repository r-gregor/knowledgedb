Advanced Copy Command – Shows Progress Bar While Copying Large Files/Folders in Linux

   Advanced-Copy is a powerful command line program which is very much similar, but little modified
   version of original cp command. This modified version of cp command adds a progress bar along with
   total time taken to complete, while copying large files from one location to another. This additional
   feature is very useful especially while copying large files, and this gives an idea to user about the
   status of copy process and how long it takes to complete.

Download and Install Advanced-Copy

   There are two methods to install Advanced-Copy utility in Linux systems, either you compile from
   sources or using pre-compiled binaries. Installing from pre-compiled binaries should always work
   correctly and requires lesser experience and very effective for Linux newbies.

   But I suggest you to compile from sources, for this you required original version of GNU coreutils
   and latest patchfile of Advacned-Copy. The whole installation should go like this:

Method 1: Compiling from Sources
   First, download the latest version of GNU coreutils and patchfile using wget command and compile and
   patch it as shown below, you must be root user to perform all commands.
# wget http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/coreutils/coreutils-8.21.tar.xz
# tar xvJf coreutils-8.21.tar.xz
# cd coreutils-8.21/
# wget http://zwicke.org/web/advcopy/advcpmv-0.5-8.21.patch
# patch -p1 -i advcpmv-0.5-8.21.patch
# ./configure
# make

   You might get the following error, while running “./configure” command.
checking whether mknod can create fifo without root privileges... configure: error: in `/home/tecmint/coreutil
s-8.21':
configure: error: you should not run configure as root (set FORCE_UNSAFE_CONFIGURE=1 in environment to bypass
this check)
See `config.log' for more details

   Run the following command on the terminal to fix that error and run the “./configure” command again.
export FORCE_UNSAFE_CONFIGURE=1

   Once, compilation completes, two new commands are created under src/cp and src/mv. You need to
   replace your original cp and mv commands with these two new commands to get the progress bar while
   copying files.
# cp src/cp /usr/local/bin/cp
# cp src/mv /usr/local/bin/mv

Method 2: Installing from Pre-compiled Binaries
   Instead of compiling from sources, you should download pre-compiled binaries for your Linux systems
   using following wget command.
# wget http://zwicke.org/web/advcopy/advcpmv-0.5-8.21-static.tar.xz
# tar xvJf advcpmv-0.5-8.21-static.tar.xz

   After extracting, two new programs are created inside the advcpmv-0.5-8.21-static directory. Replace
   these two command with original cp and mv commands.
# cp advcpmv-0.5-8.21-static/cp /usr/local/bin/cp
# cp advcpmv-0.5-8.21-static/mv /usr/local/bin/mv

   Note: If you don’t want to copy these commands under standard system paths, you can still run them
   from source directory like “./cp” and “./mv“.

Automatic progress bar
   If you want the progress bar to be appear all the time while copying, you need to add the following
   lines to your ~/.bashrc file. Save and close the file
alias cp='cp -gR'
alias mv='mv -g'

   You need to logout and login again to get this work correctly.

How to Use Advacned-Copy Command
   The command is same, the only change is adding “-g” or “–progress-bar” option with cp command. The
   “-R” option is for copying directories recursively. Here is an example screen-shots of a copy process
   using advanced copy command.
# cp -gR /Tecmint.com/ /data/

OR

# cp -R --progress-bar /Tecmint.com/ /data/

   Here is the example of ‘mv‘ command with screen-shot.
# mv --progress-bar Songs/ /data/

OR

# mv -g Songs/ /data/

   Please remember, original commands are not overwritten, if you ever need to use them or you’re not
   happy with the new progress bar, and want to revert back to original cp and mv commands. You can call
   them via /usr/bin/cp or /usr/bin/mv.

   I really much impressed with this new progress bar feature, at least I would know some information of
   copy operation time and exactly what’s going on.

   Overall I can say, it is really good tool to have in your pocket, especially when you are spending
   lots of time in copying and moving files through command line.
