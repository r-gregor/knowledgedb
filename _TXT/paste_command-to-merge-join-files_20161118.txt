[17]Linux 'paste' command to join/merge multiple files

   Posted on November 14, 2016 by Mandar Shinde

   Linux paste command- This article is about paste command in Linux which is used to merge lines in a
   file. It is also useful in merging lines from multiple files as we will see shortly. The general
   syntax of this command is -
   Syntax :
   paste <options> <file1> <file2> ...

   To demonstrate this, we create a test file as below -
[root@LinuxBox paste_test]$ cat country.txt
India
America
United Kingdom
Australia
Ukraine
Brazil

1. Basic usage - No option
   Basic usage of any command is when it is not used with any option. Here, we do not specify any
   option, but provide a file name as an argument to paste command and see what happens.
[root@LinuxBox paste_test]$ paste country.txt
India
America
United Kingdom
Australia
Ukraine
Brazil

   It just displays the file contents, very much same as the cat command.

2. Read input from stdin with -
   When we specify a - with paste command, it reads lines from stdin and arranges them in one column.
   When we specify two dashes, it would read the lines arranging them in two columns and so on. So, if
   we specify only one -, it would display the file contents as in previous case, similar to cat
   command.
# With piping
[root@LinuxBox paste_test]$ cat country.txt | paste -
India
America
United Kingdom
Australia
Ukraine
Brazil

# With I/O redirection
[root@LinuxBox paste_test]$ paste - < country.txt
India
America
United Kingdom
Australia
Ukraine
Brazil

3. Arranging file contents in multiple columns - with multiple -s
   As mentioned earlier, - - will arrange the file contents in two columns, while - - - will merge them
   in three columns. Lets check this.
# Two columns
[root@LinuxBox paste_test]$ cat country.txt | paste - -
India   America
United Kingdom  Australia
Ukraine Brazil

[root@LinuxBox paste_test]$ paste - - < country.txt
India   America
United Kingdom  Australia
Ukraine Brazil

# Three columns
[root@LinuxBox paste_test]$ cat country.txt | paste - - -
India   America United Kingdom
Australia       Ukraine Brazil

[root@LinuxBox paste_test]$ paste - - -< country.txt
India   America United Kingdom
Australia       Ukraine Brazil

4. Changing the delimiter - using -d option
   If you have observed, the default delimiter while arranging data in columns is whitespace. We can
   change this delimited using option -d and providing the character we wish to have as a delimiter as -
   paste -d <character> <file>. Lets verify this on terminal.
# Comma as a delimiter - 2 columns
[root@LinuxBox paste_test]$ paste -d ',' - - < country.txt
India,America
United Kingdom,Australia
Ukraine,Brazil

# '|' as a delimiter - 3 columns
[root@LinuxBox paste_test]$ paste -d '|' - - - < country.txt
India|America|United Kingdom
Australia|Ukraine|Brazil

   As you can observe in second example, we have a common delimiter | that divides data into three
   columns. We can change the other delimiter by specifying two delimiters with option -d as shown
   below:
# First delimiter = '1', Second delimiter = '2'
[root@LinuxBox paste_test]$ paste -d '12' - - - < country.txt
India1America2United Kingdom
Australia1Ukraine2Brazil

# First delimiter = '|', Second delimiter = ':'
[root@LinuxBox paste_test]$ paste -d '|:' - - - < country.txt
India|America:United Kingdom
Australia|Ukraine:Brazil

5. Merging files sequentially, one at a time - with -s option

   With option -s we can join all the lines in a file sequentially, one file at a time.
[root@LinuxBox paste_test]$ paste -s country.txt
India   America United Kingdom  Australia       Ukraine Brazil

   Lets try inserting delimiters into them.
[root@LinuxBox paste_test]$ paste -s -d ',' country.txt
India,America,United Kingdom,Australia,Ukraine,Brazil

   Now, we create another file fruits.txt as below:
[root@LinuxBox paste_test]$ cat fruits.txt
Apple
Banana
Orange
Watermelon
Guava
Pineapple

   And, lets put all things together and try joining two files with option -s and : as a delimiter.
[root@LinuxBox paste_test]$ paste -s -d ':' country.txt fruits.txt
India:America:United Kingdom:Australia:Ukraine:Brazil
Apple:Banana:Orange:Watermelon:Guava:Pineapple

6. Merge two files horizontally
   As you might know, when we provide two files as arguments to cat command, it concatenates two files
   i.e. joins them vertically. But, when we provide same two files as arguments to paste command, they
   are merged together horizontally. Lets compare both of these operations.
# 'cat' command
[root@LinuxBox paste_test]$ cat country.txt fruits.txt
India
America
United Kingdom
Australia
Ukraine
Brazil
Apple
Banana
Orange
Watermelon
Guava
Pineapple

# 'paste' command
[root@LinuxBox paste_test]$ paste country.txt fruits.txt
India   Apple
America Banana
United Kingdom  Orange
Australia       Watermelon
Ukraine Guava
Brazil  Pineapple

7. Reading lines from stdin, again - with - -
   To again remind you of - - option, it takes input from stdin and merges the file in two columns.
[root@LinuxBox paste_test]$ paste - fruits.txt < country.txt
India   Apple
America Banana
United Kingdom  Orange
Australia       Watermelon
Ukraine Guava
Brazil  Pineapple

[root@LinuxBox paste_test]$ paste country.txt - < fruits.txt
India   Apple
America Banana
United Kingdom  Orange
Australia       Watermelon
Ukraine Guava
Brazil  Pineapple

[root@LinuxBox paste_test]$ cat country.txt fruits.txt | paste - -
India   America
United Kingdom  Australia
Ukraine Brazil
Apple   Banana
Orange  Watermelon
Guava   Pineapple

# With delimiter
[root@LinuxBox paste_test]$ cat country.txt fruits.txt| paste -d ':' - -
India:America
United Kingdom:Australia
Ukraine:Brazil
Apple:Banana
Orange:Watermelon
Guava:Pineapple

   That's all. Thank you.
