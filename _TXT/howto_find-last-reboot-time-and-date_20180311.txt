Linux Find Out Last System Reboot Time and Date Command
January 31, 2018

   So, how do you find out your Linux or UNIX-like system was last rebooted? How do you display the
   system shutdown date and time? The last utility will either list the sessions of specified users,
   ttys, and hosts, in reverse time order, or list the users logged in at a specified date and time.
   Each line of output contains the user name, the tty from which the session was conducted, any
   hostname, the start and stop times for the session, and the duration of the session. To view Linux or
   Unix system reboot and shutdown date and time stamp using the following commands:

     * last command
     * who command

Use who command to find last system reboot time/date
   You need to use the who command, to print who is logged on. It also displays the time of last
   system boot. Use the last command to display system reboot and shutdown date and time, run:
   $ who -b
   Sample outputs:
         system boot  2017-06-20 17:41

   Use the last command to display listing of last logged in users and system last reboot time and date,
   enter:
   $ last reboot | less

   Or, better try:
   $ last reboot | head -1
   Sample outputs:
reboot   system boot  4.9.0-3-amd64    Sat Jul 15 19:19   still running

   The last command searches back through the file /var/log/wtmp and displays a list of all users logged
   in (and out) since that file was created. The pseudo user reboot logs in each time the system is
   rebooted. Thus last reboot command will show a log of all reboots since the log file was created.

Finding systems last shutdown date and time

   To display last shutdown date and time use the following command:
   $ last -x|grep shutdown | head -1
   Sample outputs:
shutdown system down  2.6.15.4         Sun Apr 30 13:31 - 15:08  (01:37)

   Where,
     * -x: Display the system shutdown entries and run level changes.

   Here is another session from my last command:
   $ last
   $ last -x
   $ last -x reboot
   $ last -x shutdown

   Another option as suggested by readers in the comments section below is to run the following command:
   $ uptime -s
   Sample outputs:
2017-06-20 17:41:51

How do I find who rebooted/shutdown the Linux box?
   You need to enable psacct service and run the following command to see info about executed
   commands including user name. Type the following [22]lastcomm command to see
   # lastcomm userNameHere
   # lastcomm commandNameHere
   # lastcomm | more
   # lastcomm reboot
   # lastcomm shutdown
   ## OR see both reboot and shutdown time
   # lastcomm | egrep 'reboot|shutdown'
   Sample outputs:
reboot           S   X root     pts/0      0.00 secs Sun Dec 27 23:49
shutdown         S     root     pts/1      0.00 secs Sun Dec 27 23:45

   So root user rebooted the box from ‘pts/0’ on Sun, Dec, 27th at 23:49 local time.
