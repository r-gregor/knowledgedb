12 Useful ‘dmidecode’ Command Examples for Linux Systems
January 2, 2019

   Dmidecode is a tool or command which is used to retrieve the useful information of your system’s
   hardware components in human readable format. Dmidecode is available for all the Linux like systems
   (RHEL, CentOS, Debian and SUSE). Dmidecode stands for DMI (Desktop Management Interface) table
   decoder, as the name suggests it reads the data from DMI table and represents to us in human readable
   format. DMI table holds the system hardware details like BIOS, Serial Number, RAM(DIMMs) and CPU
   details etc, apart from this dmidecode can also retrieve details about the maximum system supported
   configuration (like DIMMs & Processors etc). Dmidecode-examples-linux

   In this article we will try to cover 12 useful dmidecode examples for Linux systems.

Example:1) Understanding dmidecode command output
   When we run the dmidecode command then it displays the output on the screen, in the output we have
   the records, each record has 4 different values.
   
     * Handle – Unique identifier number
     * Type – It tells about the hardware components, in below example DMI type 38 refers to IPMI device
     * Size – Size of record
     * Decoded value – Information about the type of record, in the below example decoded values of IPMI
       device are Interface Type, Specification Version, Base Address & Register Spacing

   Let’s run the dmidecode command,
~]# dmidecode | more

   Output would be something like below

   dmidecode-command-output

Example:2) Different DMI types used in dmidecode command
   Followings are the  DMI types that are used on dmidecode command

   To display the 64-bit Memory Error information of your system, run the beneath dmidecode command,
~]# dmidecode -t 33

Example:11) Dump dmidecode command output in Hexadecimal
   In case if you don’t want to decode the dmidecode command output but you want to dump it as
   hexadecimal format, then use “-u” or “–dump” option in dmidecode command, example is shown below,
~]# dmidecode -u -t 4
or
~]# dmidecode --dump -t 4

   Note: dump option in dmidecode command becomes very handy in debugging scenarios

Example:12 ) Display dmidecode version

   Use the below dmidecode command to display its version
~]# dmidecode -V
2.12
~]#
