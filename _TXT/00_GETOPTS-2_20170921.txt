﻿Parse options in your bash script with getopt

Today i was writing a bash script that should manage some input arguments, and so i studied getopt, this is a
convenient and elegant way to manage input parameters in a bash script. With it you can define switch
(present or not) or parameters with an option, thus making your simple bash script much more professional.

Let’s see how to use this command and its options.

Please note that on Linux there are two different ways of parsing command line arguments. There is an utility
called getopt (man 1 getopt). This utility is available in all shells. Then in bash, there is another built-in
tool for parsing arguments called getopts (it’s a built-in, so it doesn’t have it’s own man-page — try
help getopts). In this article I’ll talk of the first one, after some problems with script not working in dash
i prefer to use external small programs rather than bash built-in commands.

In Debian and Ubuntu the command getopt is contained in the package util-linux that is automatically installed,
i expect that also on other Linux distribution you find it without any need of installing additional packages.

Basic usage
In getopt the parameters are parsed from left to right. Each parameter is classified as a short option, a long
option, an argument to an option, or a non-option parameter.

A simple short option is a `-’ followed by a short option character. If the option has a required argument, it
may be written directly after the option character or as the next parameter (ie. separated by whitespace on the
command line). If the option has an optional argument, it must be written directly after the option character
if present.

It is possible to specify several short options after one `-’, as long as all (except possibly the last) do not
have required or optional arguments.

A long option normally begins with `–’ followed by the long option name. If the option has a required argument,
it may be written directly after the long option name, separated by `=’, or as the next argument (ie. separated
by whitespace on the command line). If the option has an optional argument, it must be written directly after
the long option name, separated by `=’, if present . Long options may be abbreviated, as long as the abbreviation
is not ambiguous.

In my opinion the best way to present the command is with an example.

I want a script that can take the short option -h -1 -2 and -3 with an argument, like -3=Hello, and that can
also manage the following long options –help, –one, –two and –three with an argument.

#!/bin/bash
 
# Execute getopt on the arguments passed to this program, identified by the special character $@
PARSED_OPTIONS=$(getopt -n "$0"  -o h123: --long "help,one,two,three:"  -- "$@")
 
#Bad arguments, something has gone wrong with the getopt command.
if [ $? -ne 0 ];
then
  exit 1
fi
 
# A little magic, necessary when using getopt.
eval set -- "$PARSED_OPTIONS"
 
 
# Now goes through all the options with a case and using shift to analyse 1 argument at a time.
#$1 identifies the first argument, and when we use shift we discard the first argument, so $2 becomes $1 and
goes again through the case.
while true;
do
  case "$1" in
 
    -h|--help)
      echo "usage $0 -h -1 -2 -3 or $0 --help --one --two --three"
     shift;;
 
    -1|--one)
      echo "One"
      shift;;
 
    -2|--two)
      echo "Dos"
      shift;;
 
    -3|--three)
      echo "Tre"
 
      # We need to take the option of the argument "three"
      if [ -n "$2" ];
      then
        echo "Argument: $2"
      fi
      shift 2;;
 
    --)
      shift
      break;;
  esac
done


The options we have used with getopt in this example are:

-l, –longoptions (longopts)
The long (multi-character) options to be recognized. More than one option name may be specified at once, by
separating the names with commas. This option may be given more than once, the longopts are cumulative. Each
long option name in longopts may be followed by one colon to indicate it has a required argument, and by two
colons to indicate it has an optional argument.

-o, –options (shortopts)
The short (one-character) options to be recognized. If this option is not found, the first parameter of getopt
that does not start with a `-’ (and is not an option argument) is used as the short options string. Each short
option character in shortopts may be followed by one colon to indicate it has a required argument, and by two
colons to indicate it has an optional argument.

Conclusions
if you look at the example you can see that is longer to describe how getopt work than using it, you just need
to define the short and long list of options and than manage them with a while loop and a case, and you’ll have
a bash script that can smartly manage options.

***
A minor correction:
‘-h|–help’ should be ‘-h|–help)’

***
BTW, you’re missing a ‘)’ after ‘-h|–help’.
Also, while your script works perfectly on Debian (and many other distributions I’m sure), OS X doesn’t seem 
to like it.

How to use getopts to parse a script options

Objective
   Learn how to use the bash getopts builtin to parse a script options

Operating System and Software Versions
     * Operating System: - All Linux distributions

Requirements
     * No special requirements, just access to a bash shell

Difficulty
   MEDIUM

Conventions
     * # - requires given command to be executed with root privileges either directly as a root user or
       by use of sudo command
     * $ - given command to be executed as a regular non-privileged user

Introduction
   Modifying a bash script behavior via runtime options, just like we normally do with command line
   programs, can be very useful. The bash shell provides the getopts builtin command, a standard way to
   achieve this. How to use it is what we will learn in this tutorial.

Creating our tests script
   For the purpose of this tutorial, we are going to create a test script, and, with a lot of fantasy,
   we are going to call it test.sh. The purpose of this script will be to output something depending on
   the option we will provide (it won't be the most useful script in the world but it will be enough to
   explain how things work).
   Let's open our text editor and begin:
#!/bin/bash
set -e
set -u
set -o pipefail

   The provided shell options at the beginning of the scripts are not mandatory, but it's a good habit
   to use them in every script we write. In brief, -e, short for errexitmodifies the behavior of the
   shell that will exit whenever a command exits with a non zero status (with some exceptions). -u is
   another very important option: this makes the shell to treat undefined variables as errors.
   Finally the pipefail changes the way commands inside a pipe are evaluated. The exit status of a pipe
   will be that of the rightmost command to exit with a non zero status, or zero if the all the programs
   in the pipe are executed successfully. In other words, the pipe will be considered successful if all
   the commands involved are executed without errors.

The getopts construct
   After this brief digression, let's return to the main point of this tutorial and let's see how
   getopts works:
#!/bin/bash
set -e
set -u
set -o pipefail

while getopts 'lha:' OPTION; do
  case "$OPTION" in
    l)
      echo "linuxconfig"
      ;;

    h)
      echo "h stands for h"
      ;;

    a)
      avalue="$OPTARG"
      echo "The value provided is $OPTARG"
      ;;
    ?)
      echo "script usage: $(basename $0) [-l] [-h] [-a somevalue]" >&2
      exit 1
      ;;
  esac
done
shift "$(($OPTIND -1))"

   Let's analyze what we have above. First of all the getopts commands must be used inside a while loop
   so all options are parsed. Then immediately after the getopts keyword, we defined the possible
   options our script will accept. They are l, h and finally a.
   What does the colon after this last option means? It is the way we tell getopts that the option
   requires an argument. Each parsed option will be stored inside the $OPTION variable, while an
   argument, when present, will become the value of the$OPTARG one.
   Each option is managed inside a case statement, with a final ? case that will be matched whenever an
   option that doesn't exist will be provided. In that case we will just echo the user the correct
   script usage and exit with an error code.

Testing our script
   First, we are going to call our script providing a non existing option, just to test the case we
   mentioned above. Let's give the script executable permissions and then call it:
chmod +x test.sh && ./tesh.sh -c

   As expected we will receive a message telling us that the provided option, is illegal and then
   instructions about how to use the script:
./test.sh: illegal option -- c
script usage: test.sh [-l] [-h] [-a somevalue]

   While the script usage string is the one we set to be printed on usage error, the above it, it's a
   message automatically generated by getopts and it can be disabled by prefixing the options with a :.
   Now let's see what happens when we use the script the way it was meant to:
./test.sh -l
linuxconfig

   We used the l option, and the script printed onscreen the string we set in the corresponding case,
   this is also what happens if we provide the -h option:
./test.sh -h
h stands for h

   Let's now try to call the script with the a option. As said above this option requires an argument,
   and will fail if the latter is not provided:
./test.sh -a
./test.sh: option requires an argument -- a
script usage: test.sh [-l] [-h] [-a somevalue]

   As expected, the script responded with an error message, reminding us that the option we provided
   requires an argument:
./test.sh -a tux
The value provided is tux

   This time the script responded without error. Notice how the argument we provided, tux it's printed
   because it becomes the value of the $OPTARG variable.
   Using getopts, you can provide also more than one option at the time to your script, combining the
   flags when you launch it. For example, let's see what happens when we try to call our scripts with
   both the l and h options:
./test.sh -lh
linuxconfig
h stands for h

   As we can observe, both the options got processed, in the order we provided them. Of curse the
   options can be given separately, and we can also add the a option, but always remembering to add the
   required argument:
./test.sh -l -h -a tux_rulez
linuxconfig
h stands for h
The value provided is tux_rulez

The $OPTIND variable
   If we take another look at the very trivial script we have written above, we see another instruction
   at the end of the while loop: shift $(($OPTIND -1)). What is its purpose? Let's say we call the
   script this way:
./test.sh -l -h -a hello world

   When the script is invoked, the $OPTIND variable is set to 1, and it is incremented each time an
   option is parsed, until it reaches the last one. Therefore, in this case, it will have a value of 5
   when it will reach the last element, which is hello, the mandatory argument required by the -a
   option.

   shift is a shell builtin which moves the positional parameters of the script down a specified number
   of positions provided to it as a positive number, discarding the related arguments.
   The way we launched the script above, the last provided argument, "world", is not parsed by getopts,
   which at that point already finished its job.
   
   Now, if we make a shift of the value of $OPTIND - 1 (that is the effective number of the parsed
   options, 4 in this case) on the positional parameters, what remains are just the arguments that are
   not options, in this case "world", that we can access by using the $* variable later in this script.
