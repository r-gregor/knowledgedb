How to install cygwin additional packages?

   how to install the additional packages like gcc, gcc-objc, gcc-g++, make, patch, xorg-x11-base,
   xorg-x11-devel. The basic package is installed.

     * I have a pdf that says install the basic package by normal installation then install additional
       packages like gcc and others. Now i check with the command cygcheck --check-setup --dump-only as
       i read it somewhere. I didn't find gcc and others in that list.

***       
   The only thing i use setup.exe anymore for is updates and sometimes browsing for packages.
   Thankfully! Because "apt-cyg" is a god send! This guy over at github seems to stay on top of it,
   since the google code page died a long time ago. There are a few forks but this one just works great!
   https://github.com/kou1okada/apt-cyg

   Just use it like you would apt-get. Personally i have it switch between cygwinports mirror and
   standard cygwin repos. Its works splendidly well.
apt-cyg find gcc
apt-cyg install gcc
apt-cyg install make automake

   It solves dependencies, is very fast and works with x86 amd x64. You can switch the mirror it uses
   with -m options, and then isntantly search for stuff on cygwinports. Moreover it even removes things
   very well with apt-get remove "package name". It describes packages you have installed and those
   available via your specified mirrors. If you use cygwin it really is a must.

***
   Additionally, Cygwin setup.exe installer can be used non-interactively or from command line if you
   wish:
# installing custom packages
setup.exe -q -n -N -d -R c:\cygwin -s http://cygwin_mirror_you_use -l c:\packages mintty,wget,ctags,diffutils

   where -R is Cygwin root installation directory, -s Cygwin mirror where to download new packages and
   -l where the packages are stored locally. For other options, please check Cygwin FAQ.

***
   Download installer from the site and start it, choose mirror and then packages you want - setup
   won't break anything, it will install packages you want and update required ones as specified in GUI.

***
     * K. Im new to the software. and i don't know what is specified in GUI. But I have a pdf that says
       install the basic package by normal installation then install additional packages like gcc and
       others. Now i check with the command cygcheck --check-setup --dump-only as i read it somewhere. I
       didn't find gcc and others in that list.
     * just run setup.exe and follow the screens, when it will ask for packages - select gcc, gcc-objc,
       gcc-g++, make, patch, xorg-x11-base and xorg-x11-devel to be installed, that's all, the rest
       (basic) part will be installed automatically.

***
   Also
--categories ...

   This works well when you want the entire contents of Base, or Admin, or any of the Software
   Categories installed.

   Example:
setup-X86.exe --categories Base,Admin

Cygwin - Installing a specific package version using the commandline installer

   Using the commandline installer, one can easily install Cygwin with a list of wanted packages like so
setup-x86.exe -q -p='tar,sed,<more packages>'

   Is it also possible to fix the version of the packages, something like
setup-x86.exe -q -p='tar:1.2.3,sed,<more packages>'

   (this obviously doesn't work)?

***
     * It looks like you can add some regex in the -p:
       cygwin.com/cygwin-ug-net/using-utils.html#cygcheck
     * Why don't you use apt-cyg for all command-line package installation? 
     * You might be interested by this answer: stackoverflow.com/a/13020130/14673

***
   The short answer to your query is, No. Cygwin's setup -x86.exe does not give you the flexibility to
   specify version names along with package names. As per the official doc :

     The basic reason for not having a more full-featured package manager is that such a program would
     need full access to all of Cygwin's POSIX functionality. That is, however, difficult to provide in
     a Cygwin-free environment, such as exists on first installation. Additionally, Windows does not
     easily allow overwriting of in-use executables so installing a new version of the Cygwin DLL while
     a package manager is using the DLL is problematic

   There are however a couple of workarounds if you want to download a specific package:
    1. Locate a cygwin mirror that hosts the specific version. Google for your version, and if you find
       a mirror hosting that version, simply use that mirror before running setup -x86.exe. [39][source]
    2. Maintain a local pacakge repository and use the commandline options -q -L -l x:\cygwin-local\,
       where your downloaded package tree is in x:\cygwin-local\[source].
    3. Compile and install the package after you've set up cygwin using make.

how to install apt-cyg for Cygwin?

     Install apt-cyg
     You may have heard of programs like apt-get (Ubuntu), yum/dnf (Fedora), pacman (Arch), or brew
     (Mac OS X)... .. .The analogous program for Cygwin is called apt-cyg.

     Installing apt-cyg is simple. First, save this file:
     https://raw.githubusercontent.com/transcode-open/apt-cyg/master/apt-cyg . Then, use File
     Explorer to find the file in your Downloads folder and move it into C:\cygwin\bin. Then, open
     Cygwin and enter "chmod +x /bin/apt-cyg". This tells Cygwin that you want to be able to execute
     the apt-cyg command. Lastly, enter "apt-cyg mirror ftp://sourceware.org/pub/cygwin". This sets
     up apt-cyg to use the official repository when downloading programs.

   Sounds simple enough. But i have an error.
   This tutorial does not specify with what name and what extension to save that file.
   I save it as apt-cyg.txt, and move it into C:\cygwin64\bin
   This does not work. When running apt-cyg, I get the error: bad interpreter: No such file or directory
   how to install apt-cyg for Cygwin? - error
   My guess is that extension or filenames are bad. What name and extension should i use?
   Are there any more steps to this process?
   Note: I just installed cygwin on a windows 10. Please don't assume i have other tools already
   installed.

***
   Remember that the setup-x86.exe or setup-x86_64.exe downloaded from https://www.cygwin.com/ is
   the official method for installing cygwin. If you install using some other method and have problems,
   you may get little or no official support. Just use the official gui installer to install and update
   packages.

     * To answer your question, download the apt-cyg file by using a left-click save link as... with the
       name apt-cyg with no extension. You may need to supply the dot that separates the filename and
       extension. The file is a bash shell script. Use head apt-cyg | cat -A. If you see ^Ms at the end
       of lines, use d2u apt-cyg to convert line ends from \m\n to \n. Then chmod +x apt-cyg. Now you
       can execute apt-cyg.

***
   It seems like there is not problem with the extension but with the line endings in the script (see
   the part ^M). Similar things happen when you use git on several platforms and change unix ending lf
   to windows ending clrf and so.

   Consider change clrf to lf (removing cr) by the command:
sed -i 's/\r//g' apt-cyg

   There should be no extension in commands so do not add any extension to the apt-cyg after downloading
   it to /bin.

***
   You install it like this:
   1 - Make sure lynx is installed
   2 - Run lynx -source rawgit.com/transcode-open/apt-cyg/master/apt-cyg > apt-cyg
   3 - Run install apt-cyg /bin

   That's it!

Setting up Cygwin

  What is Cygwin?
   Cygwin is a "command-line interface" (i.e. a terminal, like the terminal on Linux or Terminal.app on
   Mac OS X) for Windows. You can run normal UNIX programs like "ls" and "cd", or even more
   sophisticated ones like "gcc". It also allows you to SSH into remote computers, which makes it a
   perfect alternative to PuTTY.

  Install Cygwin
   Cygwin is available as a installable download at cygwin.com. Although the site offers both 32-bit
   and 64-bit versions, you should use the 32-bit version (setup-x86.exe), regardless of your computer's
   architecture, as not everything works in the 64-bit version.

   Once you've downloaded setup-x86.exe, run the installer. The default options are all fine, so just
   click through all the prompts. Beware that the actual installation process may take up to an hour.

  Install apt-cyg
   You may have heard of programs like apt-get (Ubuntu), yum/dnf (Fedora), pacman (Arch), or brew (Mac
   OS X). These programs help manage the installation and upkeep of other command line programs on their
   respective operating system (for this reason, they are known as "package managers"). The analogous
   program for Cygwin is called apt-cyg.

   Installing apt-cyg is simple. First, save this file:
   https://raw.githubusercontent.com/transcode-open/apt-cyg/master/apt-cyg . Then, use File Explorer
   to find the file in your Downloads folder and move it into C:\cygwin\bin. Then, open Cygwin and enter
   "chmod +x /bin/apt-cyg". This tells Cygwin that you want to be able to execute the apt-cyg command.
   Lastly, enter "apt-cyg mirror ftp://sourceware.org/pub/cygwin". This sets up apt-cyg to use the
   official repository when downloading programs.

  Install packages

   Cygwin is really just a shell, so you'll need to install some packages to make it useful. Here's a
   bunch I suggest to have for 15-122:
     * wget
     * curl
     * rlwrap
     * tar
     * gcc-core
     * libpng15
     * libpng-devel
     * openssh
     * xorg-server
     * xinit
     * xorg-docs
     * xterm
     * make
     * gdb
     * vim
     * emacs

   You should install these packages using apt-cyg. To install a single package, enter into Cygwin
   something like "apt-cyg install gcc-core". To install several at a time, use something like "apt-cyg
   install xinit xorg-docs xterm make". You might find that some of the packages are already installed,
   and that's okay.

   There are tons of packages available to install in Cygwin, including familiar programs like python,
   idle, git, and zip, so feel free to check them out!

  Set up X-Forwarding
   I promise this is easier than using X-Win32.

   Just enter this into Cygwin: "echo 'export DISPLAY=:0.0' >> ~/.bashrc"

  Install C0 Locally (optional)

   Enter the following into Cygwin:
    1. mkdir /opt
    2. cd /opt
    3. wget http://c0.typesafety.net/dist/cc0-v0440-cygwin32-bin.tgz
    4. tar -xzvf cc0-v0440-cygwin-bin.tgz
    5. rm cc0-v0440-cygwin-bin.tgz
    6. echo 'export PATH=/opt/cc0/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.bashrc

                                             How do I use Cygwin?

  How to SSH into AFS
   Just use "ssh <andrewid>@unix.andrew.cmu.edu". For example, since my AndrewID is adbenson, I would
   type "ssh adbenson@unix.andrew.cmu.edu".

  How to SSH into AFS, but with X-Forwarding enabled
   First type "xwin -multiwindow &" so that X-Forwarding begins running, then SSH with the -Y flag, as
   in (for me) "ssh -Y adbenson@unix.andrew.cmu.edu".

  How to run C0 Locally
   First, make sure you've installed C0 Locally, as detailed above. Then you should be able to use coin
   or cc0 just like on AFS.
