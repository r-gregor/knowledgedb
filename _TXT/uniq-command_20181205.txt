Methods to Use Uniq Command in Linux with Examples
November 30, 2018

   uniq command linux
   If you are a Linux user and your work involves with working with and manipulating text files and
   strings, then you should be already familiar with the uniq command, as it is most commonly used in
   that area.

   For those who are not familiar with uniq command, it is a command line tool which is used to report
   or omit repeated strings or lines. This basically filter adjacent matching lines from INPUT (or
   standard input) and write to OUTPUT (or standard output). With no options, matching lines are merged
   to the first occurrence.

   Below are few examples of usage of the uniq command

1) Omit duplicates
   Executing the uniq commands without specifying any parameters simply omits duplicates and displays a
   unique string output.
   
$> ~/Documents/files$cat file1
Hello
Hello
How are you?
How are you?
Thank you
Thank you

$> ~/Documents/files$ uniq file1
Hello
How are you?
Thank you

2) Display number of repeated lines
   With the -c parameter, it is possible to view the duplicate line count in a file
   
$> ~/Documents/files$ cat file1
Hello
Hello
How are you?
How are you?
Thank you
Thank you

$> ~/Documents/files$ uniq -c file1
      2 Hello
      2 How are you?
      2 Thank you

3) Print only the duplicates
   By using -d parameter, we can select only the lines which have been duplicated inside a file
   
$> ~/Documents/files$ cat file1
Hello
Hello
Good morning
How are you?
How are you?
Thank you
Thank you
Bye

$> ~/Documents/files$ uniq -d file1
Hello
How are you?
Thank you

4) Ignore case when comparing
   Normally when you use the uniq command it take the case of letters into consideration. But if you
   want to ignore the case, you can use -i parameter
   
$> ~/Documents/files$ cat file1
Hello
hello
How are you?
How are you?
Thank you
thank you

$> ~/Documents/files$ uniq file1
Hello
hello
How are you?
Thank you
thank you

$> ~/Documents/files$ uniq -i file1
Hello
How are you?
Thank you

5) Only print unique lines
   If you only want to see the unique lines in a file, you can use -u parameter
   
$> ~/Documents/files$ cat file1
Hello
Hello
Good morning
How are you?
How are you?
Thank you
Thank you
Bye
$> ~/Documents/files$ uniq -u file1
Good morning
Bye

6) Sort and find duplicates
   Sometimes duplicate entries may contain in different places of a files. In that case if we simply use
   the uniq command, it will not detect these duplicate entries in different lines. In that case we
   first need to sort the file and then we can find duplicates
   
$> ~/Documents/files$ cat file1
Adam
Sara
Frank
John
Ann
Matt
Harry
Ann
Frank
John

$> ~/Documents/files$ sort file1 | uniq -c
      1 Adam
      2 Ann
      2 Frank
      1 Harry
      2 John
      1 Matt
      1 Sara

7) Save the output in another file
   The output of our uniq command can be simply saved in another file as below
   
$> ~/Documents/files$ cat file1
Hello
Hello
How are you?
Good morning
Good morning
Thank you

$> ~/Documents/files$ uniq -u file1
How are you?
Thank you

$> ~/Documents/files$ uniq -u file1 output
$> ~/Documents/files$ cat output
How are you?
Thank you

8) Ignore characters
   In order to ignore few characters at the beginning you can use -s parameter, but you need to specify
   the number of characters you need to ignore
   
$> ~/Documents/files$ cat file1
1apple
2apple
3pears
4banana
5banana

$> ~/Documents/files$ uniq -s 1 file1
1apple
3pears
4banana
