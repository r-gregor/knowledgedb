Which Is The Best Compression Tool For Linux?

Introduction
   When it comes to finding file compression tools in Linux you are left with a number of different
   choices but which one is the best?

   In this guide I will put [30]zip, [31]gzip and [32]bzip2 through their paces to see which one is
   best.

   I have conducted a number of tests against different file types and using different settings for each
   tool and here are the results

Best Tool For Compressing Windows Documents
   Before looking at a more detailed test I wanted to try each compression tool against a single file
   type so that we could see how each tool handles the file in question.

   These tests have been run against the [33]Microsoft DOCX format.

   Default Settings

   I have started with default settings for each program.
   
   Tool			File Size
   Initial Filesize	12202 bytes
   zip			9685
   gzip			9537
   bzip2		10109


   Best Compression
   This time I have gone for maximum compression,
   
   Tool			File Size
   Initial Filesize	12202 bytes
   zip			9677
   gzip			9530
   bzip2		10109

   To make sure this wasn't a fluke I tried the same test against 2 other documents.

   File 1:
   Tool			File Size
   Initial Filesize	14913176
   zip			14657475
   gzip			14657328
   bzip2		14741042


   File 2:
   Tool			File Size
   Initial Filesize	13314
   zip			10814
   gzip			10653
   bzip2		11254

   Two of the files contained text only whereas the larger file contained a lot of pages of text with
   lots of images and a lot of formatting.

   From the first test gzip comes out on top in all categories and bzip2 is the least effective.

Best Tool For Compressing Images
   This time I am going to show the results of compressing various image formats such as [34]PNG and
   [35]JPG.

   In theory JPG files are already compressed and therefore may not compress at all and could in theory
   make the file bigger.

   PNG File
   Tool             File Size
   Initial Filesize 345265
   zip              345399
   gzip             345247
   bzip2            346484

   JPEG File
   Tool             File Size
   Initial Filesize 44340
   zip              44165
   gzip             44015
   bzip2            44281

   Bitmap File
   Tool             File Size
   Initial Filesize 3113334
   zip              495028
   gzip             494883
   bzip2            397569

   GIF File
    Tool            File Size
   Initial Filesize 6164
   zip              5772
   gzip             5627
   bzip2            6051


   In all cases gzip came out on top again except for one and that was the humble bitmap. The bzip2
   compression produced a tiny file in comparison to the original.

Best Tool For Compressing Audio Files

   The most common audio format is [36]MP3 and in theory this has already been compressed so the tools
   may actually end up increasing the file size.

   I am going to test two files:

   File 1:
    Tool            File Size
   Initial Filesize 5278905
   zip              5270224
   gzip             5270086
   bzip2            5270491

   File 2:
    Tool            File Size
   Initial Filesize 4135331
   zip              4126138
   gzip             4126000
   bzip2            4119410

   This time the results were inconclusive. The compression in all cases was minimal but it is
   interesting that bzip2 came out the worst for file 1 and the best for file 2.

Best Tool For Compressing Video
   In this test I am going to compress 2 video files. As with MP3 the [37]MP4 file already contains a
   level of compression and so the results will probably prove to be negligible in terms of how well the
   tools perform.

   I have also included an [38]FLV file which will not have any level of compression as it is a lossless
   format.

   MP4:
   Tool             File Size
   Initial Filesize 731908
   zip              478546
   gzip             478407
   bzip2            478042

   Yet again the bzip2 format came out better than the other file types. At this stage it would seem
   that there is little difference as to which tool you use. The results are close across the board for
   all file types and sometimes gzip is best and others bzip2 is best and the zip command is usually
   there or thereabouts.

   FLV:
   Tool            File Size
   Initial Filesize 7833634
   zip              4339169
   gzip             4339030
   bzip2            4300295

   It would appear that if you are compressing video that bzip2 is the compression tool of choice.

Executables
   The last single category that I will try is executables.

   As executables are compiled code I suspect that they won't compress very well.

   File 1:
   Tool             File Size
   Initial Filesize 26557472
   zip              26514031
   gzip             26513892
   bzip2            26639209

   File 2:
   Tool             File Size
   Initial Filesize 195629144
   zip              193951631
   gzip             193951493
   bzip2            194834876

   Again we see that gzip comes out on top and bzip2 comes last. For the smaller executable the bzip
   file actually grew in size.

Complete Folder Test
   Thus far I have dealt with individual files. This time I have a folder full of images, documents,
   spreadsheets, videos, audio files, executables and many other different file formats.

   I have created a tar file which makes it easier to compress using all of the tools available. The
   gzip and bzip2 commands work against single files whereas the zip command can work against folders.

   By using the tar command I have created a single file which contains all of the folders and files in
   an uncompressed format.

   I am going to monitor a number of things in this test:
     * Compress using default compression settings - report results by file sizes
     * Compress using default compression settings - report results by time taken
     * Compress using best compression - report results by file sizes
     * Compress using best compression - report results by time taken
     * Compress using fastest compression - report results by file sizes
     * Compress using fastest compression - report results by time taken

   Default Compression
   Tool         File Size  Time Taken
   Initial File 1333084160 0
   zip          1303177778 1 minute 10 seconds
   gzip         1303177637 1 minute 35 seconds
   bzip2        1309234947 6 minutes 5 seconds

   Maximum Compression
   Tool         File Size  Time Taken
   Initial File 1333084160 0
   zip          1303107894 1 minute 10 seconds
   gzip         1303107753 1 minute 35 seconds
   bzip2        1309234947 6 minutes 10 seconds

   Fastest Compression
   Tool         File Size  Time Taken
   Initial File 1333084160 0
   zip          1304163943 1 minute 0 seconds
   gzip         1304163802 1 minute 15 seconds
   bzip2        1313557595 6 minutes 10 seconds

Summary
   Based on the final test it is clear that bzip2 is not as useful as the other 2 compression tools. It
   takes longer to compress the files and the final file size is larger.

   The difference between zip and gzip is negligible and whilst gzip generally comes out on top the zip
   format is more common across different operating systems.

   So my verdict is definitely use either zip or gzip but maybe bzip2 has had its day and needs to be
   confined to history.
