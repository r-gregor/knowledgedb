How to Scan for Rootkits, backdoors and Exploits Using ‘Rootkit Hunter’ in Linux

   Guys, if you are a regular reader of tecmint.com you will notice that this is our third article on
   security tools. In our previous two articles we have given you all the guidance in how to secure
   Apache and Linux Systems from Malware, DOS and DDOS attacks using [63]mod_security and mod_evasive
   and [64]LMD (Linux Malware Detect).

   Again we are here to introduce a new security tool called Rkhunter (Rootkit Hunter). This article
   will guide you a way to install and configure RKH (RootKit Hunter) in Linux systems using source
   code.

Step 4: Setting Cronjob and Email Alerts
   Create a file called rkhunter.sh under /etc/cron.daily/, which then scans your file system every day
   and sends email notifications to your email id. Create following file with the help of your favourite
   editor.
# vi /etc/cron.daily/rkhunter.sh

   Add the following lines of code to it and replace “YourServerNameHere” with your “Server Name” and
   “your@email.com” with your “Email Id“.
#!/bin/sh
(
/usr/local/bin/rkhunter --versioncheck
/usr/local/bin/rkhunter --update
/usr/local/bin/rkhunter --cronjob --report-warnings-only
) | /bin/mail -s 'rkhunter Daily Run (PutYourServerNameHere)' your@email.com

   Set execute permission on the file.
# chmod 755 /etc/cron.daily/rkhunter.sh

Step 5: Manual Scan and Usage
   To scan the entire file system, run the Rkhunter as a root user.
# rkhunter --check
