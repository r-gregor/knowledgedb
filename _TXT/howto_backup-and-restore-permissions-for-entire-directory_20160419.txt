How to backup and restore permissions of the entire directory on Linux
The following two commands getfacl and setfacl are very handy tools as they allow Linux administrators to take
a snapshot of any current permissions settings of any directory and if needed re-apply those permissions back
recursively. Let's have a look at the following example:
	$ tree -p
	.
	+---[dr---w----]  dir1
	|   +--[drwxr-xr-x]  dir2
	|      +---[dr--r-xrw-]  dir3
	|      +---[---x--x--x]  file1
	|
	+---[drwxr-xr-x]  dir4
	|   +--[-rw-r--r--]  file3
	|
	+---[-rwxrwxrwx]  file2
	
	4 directories, 3 files
	
The above output list all files and directories in a tree like structure along with all relevant permissions
for each file and directory. Now we use getfacl command in order to make a backup of all permissions for each
file and directory:
	$ getfacl -R . > permissions_backup
	
The above command saved all permissions including an ownership for each file and directory recursively into a
file called permissions_backup.
	# cat permissions_backup 
	# file: .
	# owner: lubos
	# group: lubos
	user::rwx
	group::r-x
	other::r-x

	# file: file2
	# owner: lubos
	# group: lubos
	user::rwx
	group::rwx
	other::rwx

	# file: dir4
	# owner: lubos
	# group: lubos
	user::rwx
	group::r-x
	other::r-x

	# file: dir4/file3
	# owner: lubos
	# group: lubos
	user::rw-
	group::r--
	other::r--

	# file: dir1
	# owner: lubos
	# group: lubos
	user::r--
	group::-w-
	other::---

	# file: dir1/dir2
	# owner: lubos
	# group: lubos
	user::rwx
	group::r-x
	other::r-x

	# file: dir1/dir2/dir3
	# owner: lubos
	# group: lubos
	user::r--
	group::r-x
	other::rw-

	# file: dir1/dir2/file1
	# owner: lubos
	# group: lubos
	user::--x
	group::--x
	other::--x
	
Next, we change all permissions:
	$ chmod -R 777 .
	$ tree -p
	.
	+---[drwxrwxrwx]  dir1
	|   +--[drwxrwxrwx]  dir2
	|      +--[drwxrwxrwx]  dir3
	|      +--[-rwxrwxrwx]  file1
	|
	+---[drwxrwxrwx]  dir4
	|   +--[-rwxrwxrwx]  file3
	|
	+---[-rwxrwxrwx]  file2
	
As we can see all permissions are changed and now we can use setfacl command along with our permissions backup
file generated previously to restore former permission settings:
	$ setfacl --restore=permissions_backup 
	$ tree -p
	.
	+---[dr---w----]  dir1
	|   +--[drwxr-xr-x]  dir2
	|      +--[dr--r-xrw-]  dir3
	|      +--[---x--x--x]  file1
	|
	+---[drwxr-xr-x]  dir4
	|   +--[-rw-r--r--]  file3
	|
	+---[-rwxrwxrwx]  file2
