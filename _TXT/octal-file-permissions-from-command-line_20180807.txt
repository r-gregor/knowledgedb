How to get octal file permissions on Linux/Unix command line
August 1, 2018

   I am a new Linux command line user. How do I find file permissions in octal format such as 0644 from
   the bash command line running on a Linux or Unix operating systems? How can I get the octal
   permissions for a file? How do I get octal file permissions on Linux/Unix?
   You need to use the stat command to view or get octal file permissions for given filename. By default
   the ls command will not display the permissions on a file in octal form. The permission in octal form
   is useful for many commands such as chmod command and other sysadmin tasks.
   How to get octal file permissions on Linux/Unix command line
   This quick tutorial shows how to use the stat command to view octal file permissions.

How to get octal file permissions on Linux/Unix command line
   To get file or file system status try the stat command. However, the syntax for stat is different on
   GNU/Linux and BSD/macOS.

How to get octal file permissions from Linux command line
   The syntax is as follows to get octal file permissions on Linux:
   stat fileName
   stat -c 'Format' file
   The default output is as follows on a GNU/Linux:
   $ stat /etc/passwd
   Sample outputs:
  File: /etc/passwd
  Size: 2605            Blocks: 8          IO Block: 4096   regular file
Device: fd01h/64769d    Inode: 15469225    Links: 1

   To just see octal file permissions on a GNU/Linux:
   $ stat -c '%a' /etc/passwd
   Sample outputs:
644

   Another useful command that displays file permissions in both format:
   $ stat -c '%A %a %n' /etc/passwd
   Sample outputs:
-rw-r--r-- 644 /etc/passwd

   Where format is as follows:
   Format   Description
   %a       access rights in octal (note ‘#’ and ‘0’ printf flags)
   %A       access rights in human readable form
   %b       number of blocks allocated (see %B)
   %B       the size in bytes of each block reported by %b
   %C       SELinux security context string
   %d       device number in decimal
   %D       device number in hex
   %f       raw mode in hex
   %F       file type
   %g       group ID of owner
   %G       group name of owner
   %h       number of hard links
   %i       inode number
   %m       mount point
   %n       file name
   %N       quoted file name with dereference if symbolic link
   %o       optimal I/O transfer size hint
   %s       total size, in bytes
   %t       major device type in hex, for character/block device special files
   %T       minor device type in hex, for character/block device special files
   %u       user ID of owner
   %U       user name of owner
   %w       time of file birth, human-readable; – if unknown
   %W       time of file birth, seconds since Epoch; 0 if unknown
   %x       time of last access, human-readable
   %X       time of last access, seconds since Epoch
   %y       time of last data modification, human-readable
   %Y       time of last data modification, seconds since Epoch
   %z       time of last status change, human-readable
   %Z       time of last status change, seconds since Epoch

A note about macOS/BSD stat command
   The syntax is as follows for BSD stat command to get octal file permissions on BSD or macOS:
   stat fileName
   stat -f "Format" fileName
   The default output is as follows:
   $ stat /etc/passwd
   Sample outputs:
1518287693 66065 -rw-r--r-- 1 root wheel 4294967295 1724 "Oct 28 13:50:15 2017" "Oct 28 13:50:15 2017" "Oct 28
 13:50:15 2017" "Oct 28 13:50:15 2017" 4096 9 0x800 /etc/passwd

   To just see octal file permissions
   $ stat -f "%OLp" /etc/passwd
   Sample outputs:
644

   To displays file permissions in both format:
   $ stat -f "%Sp %OLp %N" /etc/passwd
   Sample outputs:
-rw-r--r-- 644 /etc/passwd

Conclusion
   You just learned how to use the stat command to get octal file permissions from command line. See
   stat command man page by typing the man command :
   $ man stat
