   How To Use Proxy On Linux Command Line?
   ​You have heard about a proxy sometimes but what is a proxy and how it works? The proxy provides many
   functions like anonymous navigation, access to geographically restricted content, or filter some
   content. Well basically a proxy server is a computer that acts like an intermediate between your PC
   and the internet and all the traffic looks like the Proxy server did it.
   
   How proxy works
   ​For example, If you are using a proxy and you send a request to Google your request is processed by
   the proxy server then It sends a request to Google. The IP address that Google catches is the IP
   address of the proxy server and that makes your IP  unknown to the Google server.
   Many Schools or Libraries and other places use proxies to block web pages like Social Networks. You
   send a request for Facebook then the proxy server filters the ip address for the website and returns
   a notification that the domain is blocked.
   
   Access restricted content from proxy server
   ​In another [http://www.linuxandubuntu.com/home/what-is-a-vpn-connection-why-to-use-vpn] post we talk about
   VPN, but What is the difference between a proxy and a VPN?
   Well the VPN (Virtual Private Network) create an Encrypted tunnel between the server and your PC, but
   according to the provider, this can save some registries about your activity. A good VPN provider
   tries to avoid saving your activity. To use a VPN you must have a VPN client while to use a proxy you
   only need to do some configurations. Also, you can use a VPN to access to restricted geographic
   content from services like Netflix, Youtube, and others. But if you want to know more we have an
   article dedicated for VPN.

How to set a proxy?
   ​If you want to set a proxy you need to edit the file /etc/environment
   sudo nano /etc/environment
   ​and then put these lines -
   http_proxy=http://10.1.1.1:3128/
   https_proxy=http://10.1.1.1:3128/
   ftp_proxy=http://10.1.1.1:3128/
   no_proxy="localhost,127.0.0.1,localaddress,.localdomain.com"
   HTTP_PROXY=http://10.1.1.1:3128/
   HTTPS_PROXY=10.1.1.1:3128/
   FTP_PROXY=10.1.1.1:3128/
   NO_PROXY="localhost,127.0.0.1,localaddress,.localdomain.com"
   ​If you also want to use a proxy to apt-get  you need to add this lines -
   Acquire::http::proxy "http://10.1.1.1:3128";
   Acquire::ftp::proxy "http://10.1.1.1:3128";
   Acquire::https::proxy "http://10.1.1.1:3128";
   Where
   http_proxy is the system variable that you want to edit
   http://10.1.1.1:3128 is the IP address of your proxy server and its port
   ​If you are scared to the terminal you also can go to the system settings -> network -> network proxy
   and add your configuration.

Conclusion
   ​We hope that the article will be useful for you. A proxy server is a good option if you want to
   browse anonymously, these days the privacy is something that people don’t care, we are owners of our
   data and is our obligation to take care of it. To the end of the day, the use of a VPN or a Proxy
   depends on you and your needs.
   So there you have it.
