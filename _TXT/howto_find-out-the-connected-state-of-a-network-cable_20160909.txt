How to find out the connected state of a network cable in Linux

Find out the connected state of a network cable in Linux
   In this brief tutorial, we are going to see how to find out whether the network cable is connected
   with the Network interface card or not. Though, there are other number of ways to do this, I prefer
   the following two methods often to check the physical connected or disconnected state of a network
   cable or connector. These methods are quite simple to follow. You can directly go and check on the
   back of your system if the cable is connected in the port, but it is not necessary. We can do this
   using a single command. Follow me.

Method 1
   To find out the connected state of a network cable in Linux, just run:
cat /sys/class/net/enp5s0/carrier

   Sample output:
1

   If you got output as “1” (Number one), It means that the network cable is connected with your network
   card.

   Also, you can do this with command:
cat /sys/class/net/enp5s0/operstate

   Sample output:
up

   As you in the above outputs, the network cable is connected with the Lan adapter. Here, “enp5s0” is
   my network card name. You can find out the name of your network card using “ifconfig” or “ip addr”
   commands.

   Not only wired network card, we can also find the state of a wireless network card too.

   To do so, run:
cat /sys/class/net/wlp9s0/carrier

   Sample output:
1

   Or,
cat /sys/class/net/wlp9s0/operstate

   Sample output:
up

   Now, let me disconnect the network cable and see what will be the output.
cat /sys/class/net/enp5s0/carrier

   Sample output:
0

   Or,
cat /sys/class/net/enp5s0/operstate

   Sample output:
down

   See? We got results as “0” (zero) and “down”, which means that the cable is not connected. It doesn’t
   matter whether you configured the IP address to the card or not. You can easily find out if the cable
   is connected or not using the above commands.

Method 2:
   In case the above commands doesn’t work, there is another tool called “ethtool” to help you. ethtool
   is used to query and control network device driver and hardware settings, particularly for wired
   Ethernet devices.

   Run the following command to find out the connected state of a network cable:
sudo ethtool enp5s0

   Sample output:
Settings for enp5s0:
 Supported ports: [ TP MII ]

 drv probe ifdown ifup

   To find out the state of wireless network card:
sudo ethtool wlp9s0

   Sample output:
Settings for wlp9s0:
 Link detected: yes

   Let us disconnect the cable, and see what happens.
sudo ethtool enp5s0

   Sample output:
Settings for enp5s0:
 Supported ports: [ TP MII ]
 Supported link modes: 10baseT/Half 10baseT/Full
 100baseT/Half 100baseT/Full

   As you see in the above output, the network cable is not plugged in.
