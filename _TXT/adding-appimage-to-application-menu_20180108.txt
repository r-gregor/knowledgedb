Adding an AppImage to the application menu
These days the concept of portable applications which can be downloaded and run on any Linux distribution is
increasingly popular. A lot of distributions are moving to support portable technologies like Flatpak and Snap
packages. However, while Flatpak and Snap both require a supporting framework to be available for applications
to run, there are other portable package formats which are entirely self-contained and do not need
distribution-level support. 

We have talked about these portable package formats before and one of the most easy to use, portable packages
is AppImage. An application which has been built as an AppImage is downloaded as a single file. This file can
be made executable and then run on virtually any Linux distribution as the one file contains all of the
application's dependencies. 

One drawback to working with AppImages is most applications distributed as an AppImage will not integrate
themselves into our desktop environment. This makes it less convenient to run an AppImage than an application
which is installed via our operating system's software manager. In this Tips and Tricks column we are going to
explore how to set up a short-cut in our desktop's application menu which can be used to run an AppImage 
bundle, or any other program. 

The first thing we need to do is make sure the AppImage file, or other program we want to run, is executable.
From the command line we can do this with the chmod program. In this example we will make the AppImage for
AwesomeGame executable and then create a short-cut for it. The following commands make the
AwesomeGame.AppImage bundle executable so we can run it. In this example I assume the AwesomeGame.AppImage
bundle is in my Downloads directory.
cd /home/jesse/Downloads
chmod a+x AwesomeGame.AppImage

We can test to make sure the AppImage bundle works by running it directly on the command line using
./AwesomeGame.AppImage

Once we have confirmed the bundle runs and works as expected we can then create a short-cut to the game. To
make a short-cut in our application menu we need to create a special file, called a .desktop file. This file
must be saved in our .local/share/applications directory. We can use any text editor to create this .desktop
file, I'm going to use the KWrite text editor:
kwrite ~/.local/share/applications/AwesomeGame.desktop

In this new text file we need to place a series of lines which describe what the short-cut points to. In my
case the new text file will look like this:
[Desktop Entry]
Name=AwesomeGame
Categories=Game
Comment=This is a short-cut to the AwesomeGame AppImage
Exec=/home/jesse/Downloads/AwesomeGame.AppImage
Type=Application

The "[Desktop Entry]" line at the top will be the same for every short-cut and should always be the first line.
The Name field is what we want to be shown in the application menu and is usually something short so it fits
in the menu. The Categories field can be blank, but should match the name of a sub-menu, like "Office" or
"Game" or "Internet". The Comment field can be anything at all and I like to briefly describe what I am going
to access. The Type field should always be set to "Application" for programs we plan to run. 

The Exec field is the full path where our program can be found. In my case, I want to run the bundle called
AwesomeGame.AppImage in my Downloads directory. Once this file has been saved, a new entry called AwesomeGame
should appear in our application menu. 

The above example assumes we are the only user who wants to be able to run the AwesomeGame program and so we
only added a launcher to our own application menu. Our personal launchers are all kept
in the ~/.local/share/applications directory. If we want to make this launcher available to everyone using our
computer, we can move the launcher into everyone's application menu by placing our AwesomeGame.desktop file in
the global menu location, /usr/share/applications. We can do this by moving our launcher:
sudo mv ~/.local/share/applications/AwesomeGame.desktop /usr/share/applications/

While this approach works for AppImage programs, it will also work for any application we have downloaded
which does not get added to our application menu automatically.
