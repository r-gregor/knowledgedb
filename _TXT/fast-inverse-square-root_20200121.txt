As a software engineer, what's the most ingenious line of code you've seen?

By far, it’s this one:

    float Q_rsqrt( float number )
    {
    	long i;
    	float x2, y;
    	const float threehalfs = 1.5F;
    	x2 = number * 0.5F;
    	y  = number;
    	i  = * ( long * ) &y;                       // evil floating point bit level hacking
    	i  = 0x5f3759df - ( i >> 1 );               // what the fuck? 
    	y  = * ( float * ) &i;
    	y  = y * ( threehalfs - ( x2 * y * y ) );   // 1st iteration
    //	y  = y * ( threehalfs - ( x2 * y * y ) );   // 2nd iteration, this can be removed
    	return y;
    }

It’s from Quake 3 source code, with original comments. The goal was to compute inverse square root ​1⁄√x.
The point is, this hackery was at least 4 times more performant than any other alternative at that time.
