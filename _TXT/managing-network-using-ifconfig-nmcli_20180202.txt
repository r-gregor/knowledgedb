Managing network connections using IFCONFIG & NMCLI commands
February 2, 2018

   Earlier we have discussed how we can configure network connections using three different methods i.e.
   by editing network interface file, by using GUI & by using nmtui command ([29]READ ARTICLE HERE). In
   this tutorial, we are going to use two other methods to configure network connections on our
   RHEL/CentOS machines.
   First utility that we will be using is ‘ifconfig’ & we can configure network on almost any Linux
   distribution using this method.

Using Ifconfig

View current network settings
   To view network settings for all the active network interfaces, run
   $ ifconfig

   To view network settings all active, inactive interfaces, run
   $ ifconfig -a

   Or to view network settings for a particular interface, run
   $ ifconfig enOs3


Assigning IP address to an interface
   To assign network information on an interface i.e. IP address, netmask & broadcast address, syntax is
   ifconfig enOs3 IP_ADDRESS netmask SUBNET broadcast BROADCAST_ADDRESS
   here, we need to pass information as per our network configurations. An example would be
   $ ifconfig enOs3 192.168.1.100 netmask 255.255.255.0 broadcast 192.168.1.255

   This will assign IP 192.168.1.100 on our network interface enOs3. We can also just modify IP or
   subnet or broadcast address by running the above command with only that parameter like,
   $ ifconfig enOs3 192.168.1.100
   $ ifconfig enOs3 netmask 255.255.255.0
   $ ifconfig enOs3 broadcast 192.168.1.255


Enabling or disabling a network interface
   To enable a network interface, run
   $ ifconfig enOs3 up

   To disable a network interface, run
   $ ifconfig enOs3 down

   Note:- When using ifconfig , entries for the gateway address are to be made in /etc/network file or
   use the following ‘route’ command to add a default gateway,
   $ route add default gw 192.168.1.1 enOs3

   For adding DNS, make an entry in /etc/resolv.conf.


Using NMCLI
   NetworkManager is used as default networking service on RHEL/CentOS 7 versions. It is a very powerful
   & useful utility for configuring and maintaining network connections. & to control the NetworkManager
   daemon we can use ‘nmcli’.

   Syntax for using nmcli is,
   $ nmcli [ OPTIONS ] OBJECT { COMMAND | help }


Viewing current network settings
   To display the status of NetworkManager, run
   $ nmcli general status

   to display only the active connections,
   $ nmcli connection show -a

   to display all active and inactive connections, run
   $ nmcli connection show

   to display a list of devices recognized by NetworkManager and their current status, run
   $ nmcli device status


Assigning IP address to an interface
   To assign IP address & default gateway to a network interface, syntax for command is as follows,
   $ nmcli connection add type ethernet con-name CONNECTION_name ifname INTERFACE_name ip4 IP_address
   gw4 GATEWAY_address

   Change the fields as per you network information, an example would be
   $ nmcli connection add type ethernet con-name office ifname enOs3 ip4 192.168.1.100 gw4 192.168.1.1

   Unlike ifconfig command , we can set up a DNS address using nmcli command. To assign a DNS server to
   an interface, run
   $ nmcli connection modify office ipv4.dns “8.8.8.8”

   Lastly, we will bring up the newly added connection,
   $ nmcli connection up office ifname enOs3


Enabling or disabling a network interface
   For enabling an interface using nnmcli, run
   $ nmcli device connect enOs3

   To disable an interface, run
   $ nmcli device disconnect enOs3

   That’s it guys. There are many other uses for both of these commands but examples mentioned here
   should get you started. If having any issues/queries, please mention them in the comment box down
   below.
