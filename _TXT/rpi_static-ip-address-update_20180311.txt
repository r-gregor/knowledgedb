How to give your Raspberry Pi a Static IP Address - UPDATE
April 20, 2016

   This tutorial will show you how to set a static IP address on your Pi with the release of Raspbian
   Jessie. At the time of writing, the latest release date of Raspbian Jessie is 18-03-2016 with Kernel
   version 4.1.

   I recommend doing this on a fresh install, however if you have attempted to set a static IP address
   already, you may have found yourself editing the interfaces file (/etc/network/interfaces). I hope
   you made a backup, because you’ll need to remove any edits you have made, and revert it back to its
   original state!

   The following is done over SSH, but you could just as well plug your Pi into a monitor, hook up a
   keyboard and mouse, and use the Terminal instead.

   Start by editing the dhcpcd.conf file

   sudo nano /etc/dhcpcd.conf

   Scroll all the way to the bottom of the file and add one, or both of the following snippets.
   Depending on whether you want to set a static IP address for a wired connection or a wireless
   connection eth0 = wired, wlan0 = wireless.

   You’ll need to edit the numbers in the snippet so they match your network configuration.

   CODE
   interface eth0
   static ip_address=192.168.0.10/24
   static routers=192.168.0.1
   static domain_name_servers=192.168.0.1
   
   interface wlan0
   static ip_address=192.168.0.200/24
   static routers=192.168.0.1
   static domain_name_servers=192.168.0.1


   interface = This defines which network interface you are setting the configuration for.
   static ip_address = This is the IP address that you want to set your device to. (Make sure you leave
   the /24 at the end)
   static routers = This is the IP address of your gateway (probably the IP address or your router)
   static domain_name_servers = This is the IP address of your DNS (probably the IP address of your
   router). You can add multiple IP addresses here separated with a single space.

   To exit the editor, press ctrl+x
   To save your changes press the letter “Y” then hit enter

   Now all you need to do is reboot, and everything should be set!
   reboot

   You can double check by typing
   ifconfig
