How to Block or Disable Normal User Logins in Linux

   As a system administrator, you will [62]inevitably perform scheduled system maintenances at some
   point or another. A few times, your system may also encounter some problem(s) and you will be forced
   to put it down to fix the problem(s). What ever the situations is, it is a good idea to prevent
   non-root(normal) users from connecting to the system.

   In this article, we will describe how to block non-root users logins using /etc/nologin file as well
   as a nologin shell in Linux. We will look at how to set a message that explains to users what is
   actually happening.

How to Block User Logins Using /etc/nologin File
   The primary function of /etc/nologin file is to display a message (stored in the file) to users
   attempting to log on to a system during the process of shutdown.

   Once the message has been displayed to the user, the login procedure terminates, preventing the user
   from logging onto the system.

   This can be used to block user login by manually creating the file as follows.
# vi /etc/nologin

   Add the message below to the file, which will be shown to users attempting to log on to the system.
The Server is down for a routine maintenance. We apologize for any inconvenience caused, the system will be up
 and running in 1 hours time. For more information, contact the system admin [64][email protected].

   Now you can test if it all works; as you can see from the screen shot below, a normal user tecmint is
   not able to login.

How to Block User Logins Using nologin Shell
   This method works a little differently: it only blocks a user from accessing a shell. But he or she
   can log on to the system via programs such as ftp that do not necessarily require a shell for the
   user to connect to a system.

   Additionally, it can allow you to block shell access to specific users in special scenarios.

On RHEL/CentOS/Fedora
   Simply use chsh (change shell) command to change the users shell in /etc/passwd file from something
   like /bin/bash or /bin/sh to /sbin/nologin meaning refuse a login.
# chsh -s /bin/nologin tecmint

On Debian/Ubuntu
   Here, you have to use /bin/false file. The command below changes the user tecmintâ€™s shell to
   /bin/false meaning do nothing (after user provides login credentials):
$ sudo chsh -s /bin/false tecmint
