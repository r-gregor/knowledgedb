How to get octal file permissions on Linux/Unix command line
November 5, 2017

   I am a new Linux command line user. How do I find file permissions in octal format such as 0644 from
   the bash command line running on a Linux or Unix operating systems? How can I get the octal
   permissions for a file?
   
   You need to use the stat command to view or get octal file permissions for given filename. By default
   the ls command will not display the permissions on a file in octal form, which is useful for many
   commands such as chmod command and other sysadmin tasks.
   
   This quick tutorial shows how to use the stat command to view octal file permissions.

How to get octal file permissions from Linux command line

   The syntax is:
   stat fileName
   stat -c 'Format' file
   The default output is as follows on a GNU/Linux:
   $ stat /etc/passwd
   Sample outputs:
  File: /etc/passwd
  Size: 2605            Blocks: 8          IO Block: 4096   regular file
Device: fd01h/64769d    Inode: 15469225    Links: 1
Access: (0644/-rw-r--r--)  Uid: (    0/    root)   Gid: (    0/    root)

   To just see octal file permissions on a GNU/Linux:
   $ stat -c '%a' /etc/passwd
   Sample outputs:
644

   Another useful command that displays file permissions in both format:
   $ stat -c '%A %a %n' /etc/passwd
   Sample outputs:
-rw-r--r-- 644 /etc/passwd

   Where format is as follows:
   Format                             Description
   %a     access rights in octal (note ‘#’ and ‘0’ printf flags)
   %A     access rights in human readable form
   %b     number of blocks allocated (see %B)
   %B     the size in bytes of each block reported by %b
   %C     SELinux security context string
   %d     device number in decimal
   %D     device number in hex
   %f     raw mode in hex
   %F     file type
   %g     group ID of owner
   %G     group name of owner
   %h     number of hard links
   %i     inode number
   %m     mount point
   %n     file name
   %N     quoted file name with dereference if symbolic link
   %o     optimal I/O transfer size hint
   %s     total size, in bytes
   %t     major device type in hex, for character/block device special files
   %T     minor device type in hex, for character/block device special files
   %u     user ID of owner
   %U     user name of owner
   %w     time of file birth, human-readable; – if unknown
   %W     time of file birth, seconds since Epoch; 0 if unknown
   %x     time of last access, human-readable
   %X     time of last access, seconds since Epoch
   %y     time of last data modification, human-readable
   %Y     time of last data modification, seconds since Epoch
   %z     time of last status change, human-readable
   %Z     time of last status change, seconds since Epoch

A note about macOS/BSD stat command

   The syntax is as follows for BSD stat command to see octal file permissions
   stat fileName
   stat -f "Format" fileName
   The default output is as follows:
   $ stat /etc/passwd
   Sample outputs:
1518287693 66065 -rw-r--r-- 1 root wheel 4294967295 1724 "Oct 28 13:50:15 2017" "Oct 28 13:50:15 2017" "Oct 28
 13:50:15 2017" "Oct 28 13:50:15 2017" 4096 9 0x800 /etc/passwd

   To just see octal file permissions
   $ stat -f "%OLp" /etc/passwd
   Sample outputs:
644

   To displays file permissions in both format:
   $ stat -f "%Sp %OLp %N" /etc/passwd
   Sample outputs:
-rw-r--r-- 644 /etc/passwd

   See stat command man page for more info:
   $ man stat
