Edit an old file from a previous vim session

   You just exit your vim session, but you realize you want to edit one of the files you'd opened within
   a previous session. The file name is long and the file is located in some odd directory elsewhere.

   What do you do?

   Reopen vim. Type :ol[dfiles] to see a list of recently opened files from previous vim sessions. Then,
   in normal mode issue the jump mark command '0, '1, '2, ..., to reopen the corresponding files in that
   list.

   Bonus: If you use fzf in vim, you can run the command :Hi[story] to fuzzy search the same list.

   Took me only 20 years of using vim to find this trick!

I wouldn't call "using a documented feature for its documented use case" a "trick". Speaking of documentation,
the process is explained in chapter 21 of the user manual: GETTING BACK TO WHERE YOU STOPPED VIM

    You are halfway editing a file and it's time to leave for holidays. You exit Vim and go enjoy
    yourselves, forgetting all about your work. After a couple of weeks you start Vim, and type:
'0

    And you are right back where you left Vim. So you can get on with your work.

    Vim creates a mark each time you exit Vim. The last one is '0. The position that '0 pointed to is made
    '1. And '1 is made to '2, and so forth. Mark '9 is lost.

    The :help :marks command is useful to find out where '0 to '9 will take you.

    GETTING BACK TO SOME FILE
    If you want to go back to a file that you edited recently, but not when exiting Vim, there is a
    slightly more complicated way. You can see a list of files by typing the command:
:oldfiles
1: ~/.viminfo
2: ~/text/resume.txt
3: /tmp/draft

    Now you would like to edit the second file, which is in the list preceded by 2:. You type:
:e #<2

    Instead of :e you can use any command that has a file name argument, the #<2 item works in the same
    place as % (current file name) and # (alternate file name). So you can also split the window to edit
    the third file:
:split #<3

    That #<123 thing is a bit complicated when you just want to edit a file. Fortunately there is a
    simpler way:
:browse oldfiles
1: ~/.viminfo
2: ~/text/resume.txt
3: /tmp/draft
-- More --

    You get the same list of files as with :help :oldfiles. If you want to edit resume.txt first press
    q to stop the listing. You will get a prompt:

    Type number and <Enter> (empty cancels):
    Type 2 and press <Enter> to edit the second file.

    More info at :help :oldfiles, :help v:oldfiles and :help c_#<.

Note that '1, etc. are volatile by nature and not designed for the use case of editing an old file so,
unless you understand that nature, you should probably avoid them.

Mind you, the :oldfile command wasn't there 20 years ago but it pays to stay up-to-date with your tools.

By the way... the excerpt above is representative of the whole user manual (accessible from :help
user-manual). The whole thing is written like that:
  - the language is approachable,
  - examples are concrete and practical,
  - each section builds up on the previous ones.

So think again before hastily concluding that the user manual is not worth the investment. Almost every
nugget of knowledge you are going to pick up from random YouTube videos, Reddit threads, Medium posts,
or Twitter farts will be little more than a decontextualised re-hashing of the user manual. Serendipity
may have some value, in general, but it is worthless and unreliable for core competencies.

Help pages for:
    usr_21.txt in usr_21.txt
    :marks in motion.txt
    :oldfiles in starting.txt
    v:oldfiles in eval.txt
    c_#< in cmdline.txt

You know how you can use % in the argument of ex commands and it is replaced by the current buffer name? Well
#<123 works the same and can be used the same way, except that Vim will replace it with the entry number
123 in v:oldfiles. #<n is specific to old files, but things like %< or #<, for "current buffer without
extension" and "alternate buffer without extension" can be super useful, to create a test file from the
name of the current buffer, for example. There is also ##, that will be expanded to all the arguments.

:help cmdline-special and :help filename-modifiers are good starts.
