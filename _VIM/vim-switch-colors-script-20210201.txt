Switching colors

The script shown below defines these key mappings:

    Press F8 to use the next color scheme.
    Press Shift-F8 to use the previous color scheme.
    Press Alt-F8 to use a random color scheme.

The next/previous/random color scheme selection uses a list of scheme names maintained by the script. The list can be controlled with these commands (the default is all):

:SetColors all
    To use all installed color schemes ($VIMRUNTIME/colors/*.vim).
:SetColors my
    To use names built into the script (define these names by editing the script to change the variables c1, c2 and c3).
:SetColors blue slate ron
    To use the schemes specified (scheme names, separated with a space, for example, blue slate ron).
:SetColors
    To display the current list of scheme names.

After using :SetColors to list the scheme names (and while the list is still displayed), you could type :colors d then press Tab to expand 'd' to a color scheme name starting with 'd'. Then press Enter to invoke the color scheme (:colors is an abbreviation for :colorscheme).

Enter :SetColors now to set the current color scheme based on the time of day. Change the colors used by editing the nowcolors variable in the script, for example:

let nowcolors = 'breeze earth less aqua gothic'

Script

    Create and save file setcolors.vim containing the script below.
    In Vim, use the command :source setcolors.vim to execute the script so you can experiment with its features.
    Alternatively, if you save the script in file ~/.vim/plugin/setcolors.vim (Unix) or $HOME/vimfiles/plugin/setcolors.vim (Windows), it will be available whenever you start Vim.
