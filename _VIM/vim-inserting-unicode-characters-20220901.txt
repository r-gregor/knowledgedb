Q: How can I insert a unicode character code into a Linux text editor?

A1: In Vim you can do this by pressing Ctrl+V, the letter “u” and the 4-character hex codepoint.

A2: In gedit and in the text input boxes of many other GTK-based applications press Ctrl+Shift+U, type the character code in hex, then press Enter
