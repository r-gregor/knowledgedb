   need of a versatile terminal-based Linux text editor at one point or another. For today's guide,
   we'll keep our focus on Vim, considered the best by many, if not all, as the best Linux text
   editor or code editor ever. So, let's just skip on all those holy wars among you Vim vs.
   Emacs pundits and just keep our eye's on the 100 best Vim commands, today's topic. Emacs fanatics,
   however, please don't get upset, we'll cover that extensible editor of yours definitely in some time
   future.

Vim Commands That Will Turn You into A Vim Guru
   Below, we're presenting the 100 most useful Vim commands that will come in handy during your time
   with Vim. As we're aiming mainly to beginner Vim users, don't get daunted all you seasoned Vim
   masters. This guide will not only enhance the Vim experience of new users but also prove to be a
   valuable reference to more mature users.

   Before delving directly into the commands this guide is meant for, we want to draw your attention to
   Vim modes. Vim features two distinct modes, a command mode and an insert mode.

   When you open Vim for the first time, you're in the command mode. The command mode lets you navigate
   the screen, delete and copy text among many others. The insert mode on the other hand, as implied,
   lets users insert text into Vim's console. You can use the ESC key to switch back to the command mode
   after finishing typing.

   Vim commands

1. i
   Pressing i in the console gets you to the insert mode. Now you can start typing your texts inside
   Vim. The text you type will appear in front of the cursor key.

2. a
   It's among another commonly used Vim commands you can use to insert text. The texts will be appended
   right after the cursor.

3. I
   Want to place your texts at the beginning of the current line? The l command lets you insert text
   right at your desired location.

4. A
   This is one of my favorite Vim commands to append text at the end of my current line. It also falls
   under those Vim commands used for inserting text.

5. o
   Pressing the lowercase o creates a new line just after the current line you're in.

6. O
   The uppercase variant creates the new line before the current line.

7. gf
   You can use this handy little command to open your files under the cursor.

8. gi
   One of my most favorite Vim commands, gi restarts the insert mode in the last insert point you used.

9. wq
   Typing in long strings of text doesn't matter if you can't save them for future usage. Enter the wq
   command in the command mode to save your file and exit Vim.

10. q!
   Often you'll find yourself in a position where you're not satisfied with the texts you have typed and
   would like to close the editor without saving your contents. Entering q! in the command mode lets you
   do exactly so.

Vim Commands for Moving Around The Console
   One of the foremost reason behind Vim's ultra-fast user experience is its fast movement features. Vim
   features and supports numerous convenient Vim commands to make your life in front of the terminal
   blazing fast. Below are some of the most useful Vim commands for faster navigation.

   vim-movement-commands

11. h
   Use the h command to navigate to the left side of your Vim console. This is analogous to the left
   arrow of your keyboard.

12. l
   The l commands help you navigate to the right and is a substitute for the right arrow key.

13. k
   Use the lowercase k command to move upwards. Similar to the arrow up key.

14. j
   The j command takes you to downward and is a substitute for the down arrow key.

   The h j k l keys help you move across the screen much faster than the standard arrow keys. Prefix
   them with a number to get the most out of these Vim commands. So, for going down ten lines, instead
   of holding the key for a prolonged period of time, just type 10j. Mastering these passive Vim
   commands for navigation will enhance your productivity much faster.

15. H
   This command takes the cursor at the topmost region of your screen.

16. M
   It will put the cursor in the middle of your Vim screen.

17. L
   The capital L puts the cursor at the end of the screen.

   The H M L Vim commands come in handy whenever you want to get to an approximate portion of your
   console screen.

18. 0 or <HOME>
   Entering either 0 or the <HOME> button will take you to the start of the line.

19. ^
   This is among the most commonly used Vim commands to get to the first non-blank character in a line.

20. $
   This command will take the cursor at the end of the current line.

21. b
   The lowercase b command lets you move back by tokens.

22. w
   This command helps you move forward by tokens.

23. B
   The uppercase variant of b lets you move back by words.

24. W
   This command will let you move forward by words.

   A token is any sequence of digits, letters, or underscores; whereas a word is any non-blank sequence
   that is separated by whitespace.

25. ctrl+u
   This Vim command is basically a Page Up command. However, it moves the screen by half and holds onto
   the current cursor position.

26. ctrl+d
   The Page Down variant of the above command. Functions in the same way.

27. G
   Prefix the G command with a number to jump directly to a specific line number. Suppose, if you have
   line numbering enabled and are writing a shell script, you can go to the 10th line by merely typing
   10G.

28. #
   Given, # is the number of a specific line, entering this command will take you to that line directly.
   It's one of the most used Vim commands to jump from line to line.

29. â€œ
   This command (two back ticks) takes you wherever you just were.

   You can go-to at the start of the following sentence with this command.

31. (
   Go-to at the beginning of the earlier sentence.

32. }
   Used for going to the beginning of the next text block.

33. {
   Takes cursor at the beginning of the previous text block.
