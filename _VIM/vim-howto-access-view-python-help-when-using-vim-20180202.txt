How to access/view Python help when using vim

   I am a new Vim text editor user. I am writing Python code. Is there is a way to see Python
   documentation within vim and without visiting the Internet? Say my cursor is under the print Python
   keyword, and I press F1. I want to look at the help for the print keyword. How do I show python
   help() inside vim? How do I call pydoc3/pydoc to seek help without leaving vim?
   The pydoc or pydoc3 command show text documentation on the name of a Python keyword, topic, function,
   module, or package, or a dotted reference to a class or function within a module or module in a
   package. You can call pydoc from vim itself. Let us see how to access Python documentation using
   pydoc within vim text editor.

Access python help using pydoc
   The syntax is:
   pydoc keyword
   pydoc3 keyword
   pydoc len
   pydoc print
   Edit your ~/.vimrc:
   $ vim ~/.vimrc
   Append the following configuration for pydoc3 (python v3.x docs). Create a mapping for H key that
   works in normal mode:
   nnoremap <buffer> H :<C-u>execute "!pydoc3 " . expand("<cword>")<CR>

   
   Save and close the file. Open vim text editor:
   $ vim file.py
   Write some code:
#!/usr/bin/python3
x=5
y=10
z=x+y
print(z)
print("Hello world")

   #!/usr/bin/python3 x=5 y=10 z=x+y print(z) print("Hello world")

   Position cursor under the print Python keyword and press Shift followed by H. You will see output as
   follows:

   jedi-vim is a VIM binding to the autocompletion library Jed. It can do many things including
   display help for keyword when you press Shift followed by K i.e. press capital K.

How to install jedi-vim on Linux or Unix-like system
   Use pathogen, vim-plug or Vundle to install jedi-vim. I am using Vim-Plug. Add the
   following line in ~/vimrc:
   Plug 'davidhalter/jedi-vim'
   Save and close the file. Start vim and type:
   PlugInstall
   On Arch Linux, you can also install jedi-vim from official repositories as vim-jedi using pacman
   command:
   $ sudo pacman -S vim-jedi
   It is also available on Debian (?8) and Ubuntu (?14.04) as vim-python-jedi using [24]apt
   command/apt-get command:
   $ sudo apt install vim-python-jedi
   On Fedora Linux, it is available as vim-jedi using dnf command:
   $ sudo dnf install vim-jedi
   Jedi is by default automatically initialized. So no further configuration needed on your part. To see
   Documentation/Pydoc press K. It shows a popup with assignments:
