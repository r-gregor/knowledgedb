Close All Buffers Except the Current in Vim
2020-06-09

   Vim has default :tabonly for tabs and :only for windows to close them all except curren one, but
   there is no :bufferonly command.

   You can use BufOnly plugin; just put it to your .vim/plugin then execeture :BufOnly.

   However this can be achieved with a script:
" close all buffers except current one
command! BufCurOnly execute '%bdelete|edit#|bdelete#'

   The %bdelete command deletes all buffers.

   The # means the alternate filename. From :h _#:
# Is replaced with the alternate file name.       *:_#* *c_#*
  This is remembered for every window.

   Put this script in you .vimrc/$MYVIMRC, and then execute :BufCurOnly.

   You can map this command to any keys as always:
" Close all buffers but current
nnoremap <C-B>c :BufCurOnly<CR>

   All done!
