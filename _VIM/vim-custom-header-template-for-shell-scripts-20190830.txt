How to Create Custom Header Template for Shell Scripts in Vim
February 7, 2018

   In this article, we will show you a simple way to configure a custom header for all newly created
   bash scripts in [62]Vim editor. This means that every time you open a new .sh file using vi/vim
   editor, the custom header will be automatically added to the file.

How to Create Custom Bash Script Header Template File
   First start by creating the template file called sh_header.temp, which contains your custom bash
   script header, possibly under ~/.vim/ directory under your home.
$ vi ~/.vim/sh_header.temp

   Next add the following lines in it (feel free to set your own template file location and custom
   header) and save the file.

#!/bin/bash

###################################################################
#Script Name    :

#Description    :
#Args           :

#Author         :Aaron Kili Kisinga
#Email          :[63][email protected]
###################################################################

   The template above will automatically add the required "shebang" line: "#!/bin/bash" and your other
   custom headers. Note that in this example, you will manually add the script name, description and
   arguments when editing your script content.

   Now open your vim initialization file ~/.vimrc for editing and add the following line to it.
au bufnewfile *.sh 0r /home/aaronkilik/.vim/sh_header.temp

   Where:
     * au - means autocmd
     * bufnewfile - event for opening a file that doesn't exist for editing.
     * *.sh - consider all files with .sh extension.

   So the above line instructs vi/vim editor to read the contents of the template file
   (/home/aaronkilik/.vim/sh_header.temp) and insert it into every new .sh file opened by a user.
   
Test Custom Bash Script Header in New Script File
   Now you can test if all is working by opening a new .sh file using vi/vim editor, and your custom
   header should be auto-added there.
$ vi test.sh
