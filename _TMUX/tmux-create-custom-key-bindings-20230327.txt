A step-by-step guide to creating custom Tmux key bindings

We will cover the basic syntax of key bindings in Tmux, as well as some practical examples to demonstrate
how key bindings can be used to streamline your workflow.

   Tmux is a powerful terminal multiplexer that allows users to manage multiple terminal sessions,
   windows, and panes with ease. It is highly customizable and allows users to create custom key
   bindings to enhance their workflow. This article will explore how to create custom Tmux key bindings
   and how they can improve your productivity.

   Before diving into the details, let's discuss key bindings and why they are essential. Key bindings
   are simply keyboard shortcuts that perform a specific action. They can be used to save time and make
   your workflow more efficient. By creating custom key bindings in Tmux, you can streamline your
   workflow and perform actions quickly without remembering complex commands.

Default key bindings in Tmux
   Tmux comes with a set of default key bindings that are used to perform everyday actions. These key
   bindings are designed to work well for most users, but they may not be ideal for everyone. Here are
   some of the commonly used default key bindings in Tmux:
Ctrl-b % - Split the current pane vertically.
Ctrl-b " - Split the current pane horizontally.
Ctrl-b arrow key - Move between panes.
Ctrl-b c - Create a new window.
Ctrl-b n - Move to the next window.
Ctrl-b p - Move to the previous window.
Ctrl-b d - Detach from the current session.

   While these key bindings work well for most users, they may not be ideal for everyone. For example,
   some users may prefer Ctrl-a instead of Ctrl-b as the prefix key. Others may want to create custom
   key bindings to perform actions not included in the default set.

Creating custom key bindings in Tmux
   Creating custom key bindings in Tmux is relatively easy. All you need to do is add a few lines to
   your .tmux.conf file. The .tmux.conf file is a configuration file used to customize Tmux. If you
   don't have a .tmux.conf file, you can create one in your home directory by running the following
   command:
$> touch ~/.tmux.conf

   Once you have created the .tmux.conf file, you can start adding custom key bindings. To create a
   custom key binding, you need to specify the key sequence that triggers the action and the command
   that is executed. Here's an example:
# Custom key binding to rename the current window

bind-key r command-prompt -I "rename-window %%"

   In this example, we have created a custom key binding that renames the current window. The key
   sequence that triggers the action is Ctrl-b r. When you press this key sequence, Tmux will display a
   prompt that allows you to enter a new name for the window. Once you have entered the new name, the
   window will be renamed.

   Let's break down the bind-key command:
     * bind-key is the command that is used to create a key binding.
     * r is the key sequence that triggers the action.
     * command-prompt is the Tmux command executed when the key sequence is pressed. In this case, the
       command-prompt command displays a prompt that allows the user to enter a new name for the current
       window.
     * -I is an option that is passed to the command-prompt command. It specifies that the prompt should
       be pre-populated with the current window name.
     * "rename-window %%" is the argument passed to the command-prompt command. It specifies the command
       that should be executed when the user enters a new name for the window. In this case, the
       rename-window command is used to rename the current window to the name entered by the user.

   You can create custom key bindings for any Tmux command. For example, if you frequently use the tmux
   kill-session command to terminate Tmux sessions, you can create a custom key binding to make this
   action faster. Here's an example:
# Custom key binding to kill the current session
bind-key k confirm-before -p "kill-session? (y/n)" kill-session

   In this example, we have created a custom key binding that terminates the current Tmux session. The
   key sequence that triggers the action is Ctrl-b k. When you press this key sequence, Tmux will
   display a confirmation prompt that asks you to confirm whether you want to terminate the session. If
   you enter y, the session will be terminated.

   Let's break down the bind-key command:
     * bind-key is the command that is used to create a key binding.
     * k is the key sequence that triggers the action.
     * confirm-before is a Tmux command that displays a confirmation prompt before executing another
       command.
     * -p "kill-session? (y/n)" is an option passed to the confirm-before command. It specifies the
       prompt that should be displayed to the user. In this case, the prompt asks the user to confirm
       whether they want to terminate the session.
     * kill-session is the command executed if the user confirms they want to terminate the session.

   You can create as many custom key bindings as you need to make your workflow more efficient. The
   possibilities are endless, and you can create key bindings for any Tmux command or shell command.

Best practices for creating custom key bindings
   When creating custom key bindings in Tmux, there are some best practices that you should follow to
   avoid conflicts and ensure that your key bindings are easy to remember. Here are some tips:
     * Use a unique prefix key: By default, Tmux uses Ctrl-b as the prefix key. However, you can change
       this to any other key that you prefer. It's a good idea to use a key not used by any other
       programs or shells to avoid conflicts. For example, you could use Ctrl-a as the prefix key, which
       GNU Screen uses.
     * Use mnemonics: Mnemonics are memory aids that help you remember complex commands or key
       sequences. When creating custom key bindings, try to use key sequences that are easy to remember
       and make sense. For example, you could use Ctrl-b f to switch to the next window, where f stands
       for "forward."
     * Document your key bindings: It's a good idea to document your custom key bindings in your
       .tmux.conf file or a separate file. This makes remembering your key bindings easier and sharing
       them with others. You can use comments (#) to add notes to your key bindings.
     * Test your key bindings: Before using your custom key bindings in production, make sure to test
       them thoroughly to ensure that they work as expected. You can test your key bindings by opening a
       Tmux session and trying out your key sequences.

   By following these best practices, you can create custom key bindings that are easy to remember,
   efficient and do not conflict with other programs or shells.

   There is some additional information that may be useful to include regarding Tmux key bindings:

Unbinding default key bindings
   By default, Tmux has many key bindings already bound to various commands. If you want to create a
   custom key binding that uses a key sequence already bound to another command, you can first unbind
   the default key binding.

   To unbind a default key binding, use the unbind-key command followed by the key sequence you want to
   unbind. For example, to unbind the default key binding for Ctrl-b c (which creates a new window), you
   can use the following command:
unbind-key -n C-c

   This unbinds the Ctrl-b c key sequence from the default new-window command. You can then use Ctrl-b c
   for your own custom command.

Using multiple prefix keys
   Suppose you frequently use Tmux in different environments (such as on different machines or with
   different configurations). In that case, you may want to use different prefix keys for each
   environment to avoid conflicts. You can do this by using multiple Tmux configuration files and
   specifying a different prefix key in each file.

   To specify a different config file, use the -f option when starting Tmux:
$> tmux -f /path/to/config/file

   You can create a separate configuration file for each environment and specify a different prefix key
   in each file.

Customizing key repeat delay
   By default, Tmux has a key repeat delay of 500 milliseconds and a key repeat rate of 100
   milliseconds. This means that if you hold down a key, Tmux will repeat the key press every 100
   milliseconds after a delay of 500 milliseconds.

   You can customize these values by setting the repeat-time and repeat-rate options in your .tmux.conf
   file. For example, to set the key repeat delay to 250 milliseconds and the key repeat rate to 50
   milliseconds, you can add the following lines to your .tmux.conf file:
set-option -g repeat-time 250
set-option -g repeat-rate 50

Using Tmux plugins
   Tmux plugins are third-party scripts that extend the functionality of Tmux. Many Tmux plugins include
   custom key bindings that you can use to perform specific actions.

   To use Tmux plugins, you must install a plugin manager such as tpm (Tmux Plugin Manager). Once you
   have installed tpm, you can add plugins to your .tmux.conf file by specifying their names in the
   set-option command:
set-option -g @plugin 'tmux-plugins/tmux-sensible'

   This line adds the tmux-sensible plugin to your Tmux configuration. The tmux-sensible plugin includes
   several custom key bindings that make Tmux more intuitive and easier to use.

Using Tmux copy mode
   Tmux copy mode is a feature that allows you to copy and paste text within Tmux windows and panes. You
   can enter copy mode by pressing Ctrl-b [ (or your prefix key followed by [), then use the arrow keys
   to move the cursor and select text.

   To copy text, press Ctrl-space to set the start of the selection, and then use the arrow keys to move
   the cursor to the end of the selection. To paste text, press Ctrl-b ] (or your prefix key followed by
   ]).

   You can customize the key bindings for copy mode by adding custom key bindings to the copy-mode
   command. For example, to use Ctrl-c to copy text, you can add the following line to your .tmux.conf
   file:
bind-key -T copy-mode-vi C-c send-keys -X copy-pipe-and-cancel "xclip -selection clipboard"

   This will bind the Ctrl-c key sequence in copy mode to copy the selected text to the clipboard using
   the xclip command. Note that this requires the xclip package to be installed on your system.

   By customizing the key bindings in copy mode, you can make it easier to copy and paste text within
   Tmux without having to remember complex key sequences.

   Overall, Tmux is a powerful tool that can significantly improve your productivity and efficiency when
   working in the terminal. With custom key bindings, you can tailor Tmux to your specific needs and
   preferences and create a customized workflow that works best for you.

Conclusion
   Custom key bindings are a powerful feature of Tmux that can help you streamline your workflow and
   save time. By creating your own key bindings, you can automate common tasks, reduce the amount of
   typing you need to do, and tailor Tmux to your specific needs and preferences.

   This article covered the basics of creating custom Tmux key bindings, including how to define new key
   bindings in your .tmux.conf file and how to use the bind-key command to create key bindings on the
   fly, and how to use different key sequences and key modifiers. We have also discussed some additional
   tips and tricks, such as unbinding default key bindings, using multiple prefix keys, customizing key
   repeat delay, and using Tmux plugins and copy mode.

   Remember that creating custom key bindings is a personal and subjective process. It is up to you to
   discern which actions are most important to your workflow and how to bind them to keys that are easy
   for you to remember and use. You can always experiment with different key bindings to find the ones
   that work best for you.
