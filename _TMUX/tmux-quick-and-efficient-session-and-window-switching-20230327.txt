Quick and efficient Tmux session and window switching

We will cover the most commonly used keyboard shortcuts and navigation commands, as well as some
lesser-known features that can further enhance your workflow. We will also explore some customization
options for tailoring Tmux's window and session switching to suit your specific needs.

   Have you ever found yourself in a situation where multiple Tmux sessions and windows open, and you
   need to switch between them quickly? Tmux is a terminal multiplexer tool that allows you to create
   multiple sessions and windows, making it easier to multitask. However, if you're unfamiliar with the
   shortcuts and commands to navigate between sessions and windows, it can be a frustrating experience.

   This article will cover the basics of Tmux sessions and windows and show you how to switch between
   them quickly and efficiently. Whether you're a Tmux beginner or a seasoned user, you'll find valuable
   tips and tricks to make your workflow smoother and more productive.

Understanding Tmux sessions and windows
   Before we dive into the details of switching between Tmux sessions and windows, let's first
   understand what they are and how they work.

   A Tmux session is a container that holds one or more Tmux windows. Each session has a unique
   identifier, which you can attach to it from another terminal or detach from it to return to the
   shell. When you start a new session, Tmux will automatically create a new window and attach it to the
   session. You can then create additional windows within the session as needed.

   A Tmux window is a container that holds one or more Tmux panes. Each window has a unique identifier,
   which you can use to switch between windows within the same session or between sessions. When you
   create a new window, Tmux will automatically attach a new pane to the window. You can then split the
   pane into multiple panes as needed.

Switching between Tmux sessions
   Switching between Tmux sessions is a two-step process: detaching from the current session and
   attaching to the target session. To detach from the ongoing session, use the following command:
C-b d

   This command will detach you from the current session and return you to the shell.
   detach from session detach from session

Detach from session
   You can then use the following command to attach to the target session:
$> tmux attach-session -t target-session

   Replace "target-session" with the name or ID of the session you want to attach to.
   tmux attach previously detached session tmux attach previously detached session

   If you're not sure what the name or ID is, you can use the following command to list all the
   sessions:
$> tmux list-sessions

   Alternatively, you can use the following shortcut to switch to the last active session:
C-b (

   This command will cycle through all the available sessions and switch to the last active one.

Switching between Tmux windows
   Switching between Tmux windows is a similar two-step process: selecting the target window and
   switching to it. To choose the target window, use one of the following commands:
C-b n    # switch to the next window
C-b p    # switch to the previous window
C-b 0    # switch to window 0
C-b 1    # switch to window 1
C-b 2    # switch to window 2

   These commands will cycle through all the windows within the same session and switch to the target
   window.

   Alternatively, you can employ the following command to display a list of all the windows within the
   same session:
C-b w

   This command will display a list of all the windows, along with their names and numbers. You can then
   employ the arrow keys to select the target window and press Enter to switch to it.
   list all windows in the current session list all windows in the current session

Switching between Tmux panes
   Switching between Tmux panes is similar to switching between windows but with an additional step:
   selecting the target pane within the target window. To choose the target pane, use one of the
   following commands:
C-b Up Arrow    # switch to the pane above the current one
C-b Down Arrow  # switch to the pane below the current one
C-b Left Arrow  # switch to the pane to the left of the current one
C-b Right Arrow # switch to the pane to the right of the current one

   These commands will cycle through all the panes within the same window and switch to the target pane.

   Alternatively, you can employ the following command to display a list of all the panes within the
   same window:
C-b q

   This command will display a list of all the panes and their numbers. You can then enter the number of
   the target pane to switch to it.
   list of all panes list of all panes

Switching between Tmux sessions and windows quickly
   While the above commands are useful for switching between Tmux sessions, windows, and panes, they can
   be time-consuming if you have many of them open. Here are some tips and tricks to switch between Tmux
   sessions and windows quickly and efficiently.

Use shortcuts to switch between recent sessions

   Tmux allows you to switch between the most recently used sessions using the following command:
C-b L

   This command will switch to the last session you used, regardless of whether it was detached or
   attached. You can press the command repeatedly to cycle through all the recent sessions.
   switch between recent sessions switch between recent sessions

Use prefix-based shortcuts to switch between windows
   Tmux lets you use prefix-based shortcuts to switch between windows within the same session quickly.
   By default, the prefix key is "C-b," but you can customize it.

   Here are some useful prefix-based shortcuts for switching between windows:
C-b c         # create a new window
C-b w         # list all windows
C-b %         # split the current pane vertically
C-b "         # split the current pane horizontally
C-b <number>  # switch to window <number>
C-b n         # switch to the next window
C-b p         # switch to the previous window

   You can also customize the shortcuts using the Tmux configuration file. For example, you can add the
   following lines to the file to switch to windows using the Alt key and number keys:
# Alt + <number> to switch to window
bind-key -n M-1 select-window -t 1
bind-key -n M-2 select-window -t 2
bind-key -n M-3 select-window -t 3
bind-key -n M-4 select-window -t 4
bind-key -n M-5 select-window -t 5

Use prefix-based shortcuts to switch between panes
   Tmux allows you to use prefix-based shortcuts to switch between panes within the same window quickly.
   Here are some useful prefix-based shortcuts for changing between panes:
C-b %    # split the current pane vertically
C-b "    # split the current pane horizontally
C-b o    # switch to the next pane
C-b ;    # switch to the last active pane

C-b Up Arrow    # switch to the pane above the current one
C-b Down Arrow  # switch to the pane below the current one
C-b Left Arrow  # switch to the pane to the left of the current one
C-b Right Arrow # switch to the pane to the right of the current one

   You can also customize the shortcuts using the Tmux configuration file. For example, you can add the
   following lines to the file to switch to panes using the Ctrl key and arrow keys:
# Ctrl + <arrow key> to switch between panes

bind-key -n C-Up select-pane -U
bind-key -n C-Down select-pane -D
bind-key -n C-Left select-pane -L
bind-key -n C-Right select-pane -R

   Another worth noting is that Tmux allows you to switch between sessions, windows, and panes using the
   mouse. By default, clicking the status bar with the left mouse button brings up the list of available
   Tmux sessions. You can then select a session by clicking on it.

   Similarly, clicking on a window or pane in the status bar will switch to that window or pane. You can
   also resize panes by clicking and dragging on the divider lines between them.

   To enable mouse support in Tmux, add the following line to your Tmux configuration file:
set -g mouse on

   With mouse support enabled, you can use the mouse to switch between Tmux sessions, windows, and
   panes, resize panes and perform other actions.

   However, it's worth noting that some users prefer to use Tmux entirely through keyboard shortcuts, as
   it can be faster and more efficient once you become familiar with the commands. Additionally, some
   terminal emulators may not support mouse input, so relying on keyboard shortcuts can ensure
   consistent behavior across different environments.

   Overall, Tmux offers versatile tools for managing your terminal workflow, whether using the mouse or
   sticking to keyboard shortcuts. By mastering the various commands and shortcuts, you can streamline
   your workflow and work more efficiently in the terminal.
