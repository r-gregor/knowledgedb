How to Automatically Start or Reattach to a tmux Session with SSH
24 February 2025

   When working on remote servers, maintaining persistent workflows can save a lot of time and effort.
   By combining SSH with tmux, you can ensure that a session starts automatically upon connection-or
   reattaches to an existing one. This code snipped demonstrates how to configure your .ssh/config file
   to achieve this.

[.ssh/config]
Host hack
    Hostname hack.sizeofvoid.org
    User KawwptnBlaubaer
    IdentityFile  ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_sk
    RequestTTY yes
    RemoteCommand tmux new -A -s hackon

   Key points:
     * RequestTTY: Ensures a pseudo-terminal is allocated. This is required for interactive applications like
       tmux.
     * RemoteCommand: This is the magic command that handles tmux sessions:
     * tmux new: Starts a new session.
     * -A: Attach to an existing session if one with the same name already exists.
     * -s hackon: Specifies the session name as hackon. You can replace this with a name of your choice.
