How To Install Oracle Java 11 In Ubuntu, Linux Mint Or Debian (From PPA Repository)

   Oracle Java 11, the first long term support release, can now be installed in Ubuntu, Linux Mint and
   Debian from the Linux Uprising Java PPA. For what's new in the latest JDK11, read the [24]release
   notes.
   It's important to note that with Java 11, Oracle uses a new, commercial license. It can be downloaded
   and used without cost only for development and testing only, and it requires paying a fee if it's
   used in production:

     You may not: use the Programs for any data processing or any commercial, production, or internal
     business purposes other than developing, testing, prototyping, and demonstrating your Application.
     This quote is from the Oracle Java SE [25]license ([26]via).

   As a result, you should only use Oracle JDK if you intend to pay for it. Use OpenJDK, which is
   available in the Debian / Ubuntu repositories, for anything else. From Java 11 forward, Oracle JDK
   builds and OpenJDK builds are essentially identical with a few differences you can read about
   [27]here.
   Oracle Java 11 is available to download as a DEB package, but all the package does is install the
   files to /usr/lib/jvm/jdk-11, just like it would be if you copied the extracted directory there,
   without any options to set it as default / update the Java alternatives, set environment variables
   and so on.
   The Oracle Java installer from the Linux Uprising PPA can set Java 11 as default, set environment
   variables (JAVA_HOME, etc.) and easily undo this. The installer downloads Oracle Java 11 (64bit only
   as that's what Oracle provides) from Oracle's servers because the license doesn't allow uploading the
   binary to the PPA.
   The package in this PPA uses the Web Upd8 Java package installer as a base, but it's modified to
   install the latest Oracle JDK 11.

Install Oracle Java 11 (JDK 11) in Ubuntu, Linux Mint or Debian from PPA
   To add the LinuxUprising Java PPA repository to your software sources and install Oracle Java 11 in
   Ubuntu or Linux Mint (64bit only) you can use the commands below:
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:linuxuprising/java
sudo apt update
sudo apt install oracle-java11-installer

   In Debian (64bit only) you can add the repository and install Oracle Java 11 using these commands:
su -
echo "deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/linuxuprising/java/ubuntu bionic main" | tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/linuxu
prising-java.list
apt-key adv --keyserver hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com:80 --recv-keys 73C3DB2A
apt-get update
apt-get install oracle-java11-installer
exit

   The oracle-java11-installer package has a Recommends field for the oracle-java11-set-default package,
   which sets Oracle Java 11 as default (including setting the JAVA_HOME environment variable, which
   requires a session restart). Such recommended packages are installed automatically on Ubuntu, but are
   not on other Debian-based Linux distributions.
   So to make Oracle Java 11 default, install the oracle-java11-set-default package:
sudo apt install oracle-java11-set-default

   If you want to have Oracle Java 11 installed but not set it as the default Java, make sure the
   oracle-java11-set-default package is not installed / remove it:
sudo apt remove oracle-java11-set-default

   You can check to see if Oracle Java 11 is set as default by checking your current Java version using
   the following command:
java -version

   If Oracle Java 11 is default, you should see an output similar to the following:
java version "11" 2018-09-25
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment 18.9 (build 11+28)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM 18.9 (build 11+28, mixed mode)

   You can try it for javac as well:
javac -version

   Which should return an output similar to the one below:
javac 11

   This package supports installing Java 11 by manually downloading the archive. This is useful in case
   you're behind a firewall or your ISP somehow blocks the Oracle JDK 11 download link (so you can
   download it from a different computer, etc.). To do this, download the Oracle Java 11 tar.gz archive
   and place it in the /var/cache/oracle-jdk11-installer folder. Next, install the
   oracle-java11-installer package using the regular instructions and it should pick up the downloaded
   tar.gz archive instead of downloading it.

Automatically accept the Oracle Java 11 lincense (for automated installations)
   By default, the Oracle Java 11 installer prompts you to accept the Oracle Java license before
   proceeding with the JDK 11 installation. If you want to automate the Oracle Java 11 installation
   process, use the following command to automatically accept the license:
echo oracle-java11-installer shared/accepted-oracle-license-v1-2 select true | sudo /usr/bin/debconf-set-selec
tions

   If the command above doesn't automatically accepts the Oracle Java 11 license, try the command below
   instead:
echo oracle-java11-installer shared/accepted-oracle-licence-v1-2 boolean true | \
    sudo /usr/bin/debconf-set-selections
