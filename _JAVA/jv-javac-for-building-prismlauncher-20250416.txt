Javac for Building the PrismLauncher on Ubuntu
April 14, 2025

   I peridocially fall of the wagon and get drawn back into playing Minecraft. I've decided that, in
   order to make this time not wasted, I need to do something constructive with this urge. Last time I
   played Minecraft, I found the MultiMC launcher would no longer work. Being a fan of C++ and open
   source projects, I was not happy with this state. A friend suggested I try the PrismLauncher fork of
   the code base.

   Prism does not seem to have a native Debian based build available, although I admit I did not look
   very hard. I don't want to install flatpacks or other binary management software just for one app.
   So, I figured I would build from sources.

   I have cloned the repo and checked out the latest release version. Following the instructions
   failed fairly quickly with the error:

   error: Target option 7 is no longer supported. Use 8 or later.

   This was after a long line of Java based commands, I assumed it had to do with the fact that my
   machine is running Open JDK V 21 and we needed something older: the build instructions say Java -17,
   which I also have installed.

   For this, I had to switch the javac compiler set by default, using the alternatives framework:
   For the Java Exe this is

$> sudo update-alternatives -config java
   There are 3 choices for the alternative java (providing /usr/bin/java).
   Selection  Path                                             Priority  Status
   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   * 0        /usr/lib/jvm/java-21-openjdk-amd64/bin/java      2111      auto mode
   1          /usr/lib/jvm/java-17-openjdk-amd64/bin/java      1711      manual mode
   2          /usr/lib/jvm/java-21-openjdk-amd64/bin/java      2111      manual mode
   3          /usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64/jre/bin/java   1081      manual mode

   And for the Javc compiler
$> sudo update-alternatives -config javac
   There are 2 choices for the alternative javac (providing /usr/bin/javac).
   Selection  Path                                             Priority  Status
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   * 0        /usr/lib/jvm/java-21-openjdk-amd64/bin/javac     2111      auto mode
   1          /usr/lib/jvm/java-17-openjdk-amd64/bin/javac     1711      manual mode
   2          /usr/lib/jvm/java-21-openjdk-amd64/bin/javac     2111      manual mode

   I then needed to switch them back in order to run, as MInecraft needs a version later than 17
   (suggested 21).
