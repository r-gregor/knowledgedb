How to Install Netbeans on Ubuntu 18.04
February 19, 2019

   Netbeans is a full-featured cross-platform IDE that helps you build applications in Java,
   PHP, and many other languages.

   It has built-in debugging support, embedded [15]Git control, integrates major build automation tools
   such as Maven, Ant, and Gradle, syntax highlighting, code generators, code templates, code
   refactoring, and rich navigation capabilities.

   Netbeans is extensible via plugins and has well-documented APIs. It can also be used for development
   in other programming languages such as C/C++, Groovy, Javadoc, JavaScript, and more.

   This tutorial explains how to install Netbeans IDE on Ubuntu 18.04. The same instructions apply for
   Ubuntu 16.04 and any Ubuntu-based distribution, including Kubuntu, Linux Mint, and Elementary OS.

Prerequisites
   You’ll need to be logged in as a [18]user with sudo access to be able to install packages on your
   Ubuntu system.

Installing Java OpenJDK
   Netbeans requires Oracle Java over OpenJDK version 8 or above to be installed to your system.

   We’ll install OpenJDK 8. The installation is pretty simple, start by updating the package index:
sudo apt update

   Install the OpenJDK 8 package by typing:
sudo apt install openjdk-8-jdk

   Verify the installation by typing the following command which will print the Java version:
java -version

   The output should look something like this:
openjdk version "1.8.0_191"
OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_191-8u191-b12-2ubuntu0.18.04.1-b12)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.191-b12, mixed mode)

   If you prefer Oracle Java over OpenJDK follow [19]these instructions to install Oracle Java.

Installing Netbeans IDE
   At the time of writing this article, the latest stable version of Netbeans is version 10.0. The
   easiest way is to install Netbeans on Ubuntu 18.04 is by using the [20]snappy packaging system.

   To download and install the Netbeans snap package, open your terminal using the Ctrl+Alt+T keyboard
   shortcut and type:
sudo snap install netbeans --classic

   The process may take some time depending on your connection speed. On successful installation, you
   will see the following output:
