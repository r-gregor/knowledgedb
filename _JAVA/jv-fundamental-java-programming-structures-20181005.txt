   Fundamental Java Programming Structures

   What You'll Learn
     * A Simple Java Program
     * Comments
     * Data Types
     * Variables
     * Assignments and Initializations
     * Operators
     * Strings
     * Control Flow
     * Class Methods (User-defined Functions)
     * Arrays

   Note:
     * You are presumed to already be familiar with programming, so we will go rapidly
     * We'll make enough "reassuring noises" along the way so you will realize what you already know
     * We'll point out the differences between Java and other languages, notably C and C++

   A Simple Java Program
     * We'll start with a simple application -- applets come later
     * It simply prints a message to the console

   // A first program in Java
       public class Welcome1
       {
           public static void main( String args[])
           {
               System.out.println( "Hello, world!" );
               /* yes, "Hello, world!" yet again */
           }
       }

   What to note about our example
     * Java is case sensitive, like C, so watch your spelling and capitalization
     * The keyword public is called an access modifier

     * These modifiers control what other parts of a program can use this code

     The keyword class is there because, unlike C++, everything in a Java program is enclosed in a class
   Names in Java
     * Following the keyword class is the name of the class

     * The rules for names are similar to that of C++

     * Names must begin with a letter and after that they can have any combination of letters and digits
     * The length is essentially unlimited
     * You cannot use a Java reserved word (e.g. if, public, like C++'s reserved words)

     The convention is that class names begin with initial caps

     The file name for the source code must be exactly the same as the name of the public class, with
   the extension .java appended (i.e., Welcome1.java, not welcome1.java) The main() method
     * Every Java application must have a main() method
     * Curly braces ({}) mark the beginning and end of a block
     * All Java main methods are public static void

   Java classes and methods
     * Java classes are similar to C++ classes, but there are a few differences
     * In Java, all functions are member functions of some class (and they are called methods)
     * In Java, you have a shell class for the main method
     * In Java, as in C++, static member functions are those defined inside a class, but do not operate
       on objects
     * The main method in Java is always static

   The Body of main()
     * Contains a statement that outputs a single line of text to the console
     * We use the System.out object and ask it to use its println method
     * Java always uses the general syntax

     * object.method(argument_list) for its function calls

     The println method works with a string and displays it on the console

     There is also a print method in System.out which doesn't add a newline at the end Note about
   command-line arguments:
     * Although in Java, as in C++, the main method receives an array of command-line arguments, the
       array syntax is different
     * A String[] is an array of strings, and so args denotes an array of strings
     * Unlike C++, the name of the program is not stored in the args array
     * If we ran a Java application in Doctor.class with

   java Doctor McGuire

     * args[0] will be McGuire, not Doctor or java

   Comments
     * Java has three styles of comments
     * // begins a comment that runs from the // to the end of the line
     * /* begins a comment that terminates with the character pair */
     * /** and **/ delimit a special type of comment which is processed by the javadoc automatic
       documention tool
     * /* */ comments do not nest in Java

   Data Types
     * Java is a strongly typed language
     * Each variable must have a declared type
     * There are eight primitive types

     * six are numeric types

     * 4 integer and 2 floating-point types

     one is the character type char

     one is a boolean type Integers
   Type      Size         Range
       int     4 bytes     -2^31 to +2^31-1
                           (just over 2 billion)
       short   2 bytes     -32,768 to +32,767
       long    8 bytes     -2^63 to +2^63-1
       byte    1 byte      -128 to +127

     * These ranges are the same no matter what machine you are running on (unlike C++)
     * Java does not have any unsigned types
     * Long integer numbers have the suffix L (40000000L)
     * Hexadecimal numbers have a prefix of 0x ( 0xCAFE278 )

   Floating-Point Types
   Type       Size         Range
       float     4 bytes     +/-(10^-38 to 10^+38) (6 to 7 significant digits)
       double    8 bytes     +/-(10^-308 to 10^+308) (15 significant digits)

     * You will usually want to use double because of its extended range and greater precision
     * Numbers of type float have a suffix F
     * Numbers without a suffix are always considered double, but you may use a D suffix
     * All floating-point types follow the IEEE 754 specification

   The Character Type (char)
     * Apostrophes are used to denote char constants
     * The char type denotes characters in the 2-byte Unicode encoding scheme
     * ASCII code is the first 255 characters of Unicode
     * Unicode characters are most often expressed in terms of a hexadecimal encoding scheme that runs
       form '\u0000' to '\uFFFF', with ASCII codes being '\u0000' to '\u00FF' -- e.g. '\u2122' is ^TM
     * Check out [1]http://www.unicode.org/

   Special Characters
   Escape     Name             Unicode value
       Sequence
       \b         backspace         \u0008
       \t         tab               \u0009
       \n         linefeed          \u000A
       \r         carriage return   \u000D
       \"         quote mark        \u0022
       \'         apostrophe        \u0027
       \\         backslash         \u005C

     * In C++, char denotes an integral type (1 byte integer) in the range 0..255 or -128..127
     * In Java, char is not a number -- converting numbers to characters requires an explicit cast,
       however, characters are automatically promoted to integers without a cast

   The Boolean Type
     * The boolean type has two values, false and true
     * It is similar the C++ type bool, except that in Java, you cannot convert between numbers and
       Boolean values, not even with a cast

     * Why not? Have you ever been bitten by

   if (a = b) instead of if (a == b)?

     * So, in Java it is not true that 0 is false and non-zero is true

   Variables
     * Java uses variables in a way similar to that of C++
     * Naming rules:

     * Variable name must begin with a letter and be a sequence of letters or digits
     * A "letter" is A-Z, a-z, _ (underscore), or any Unicode character that denotes a letter in a
       language -- Germans could use 'ä', Greeks could use 'µ', etc.
     * A "digit" is 0-9 or any Unicode character that denotes a digit in a language

     All characters in the name of a variable are significant and case is significant

     There is no upper limit to the length of a variable name Conversions between Numeric Types
     * Automatic promotions of numeric types work as they do in C++
     * Demotion is done through explicit casts in the same way that C does it (the C++ form is not
       available)

   double x = 9.9997;
       int nx = (int) x; // notint(x) ala C++

     * this stores the value 9 in nx

     You cannot cast between boolean values and any numeric types Constants
     * In Java, you use the keyword final to denote a constant.

public class UsesConstants {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        final double CM_PER_INCH = 2.54;
        double paperWidth = 8.5;
        System.out.println("Paper width in cms: " + paperWidth*CM_PER_INCH);
    }
}
    
     * The reserved word final indicates that you can assign to the variable once, then its value is set
       once and for all

   Static Constants
     * It is probably more common in Java to want a constant that is available to multiple methods
       inside a single class (a class constant)
     * Class constants are defined with the keywords static final

public class UsesConstants {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        final double CM_PER_INCH = 2.54;
        double paperWidth = 8.5;
        System.out.println("Paper width in cms: " + paperWidth*CM_PER_INCH);
    } 
}

     * Note that the definition of the class constant appears outside the main method
     * Note: const is a reserved Java keyword, but it is not currently used for anything

   Operators
     * The usual operators + - * / %  are used in Java
     * As in C, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=   are also available
     * The usual way of doing exponentiation is via the statement:

     * double y = Math.pow(x,a);

     Note: the Math class in Java has a large number of functions an engineer would need (constants for
   pi and e, sqrt , ln, exp, rounding, abs, max, min, etc.) Other Operators
     * Increment and Decrement Operators

     * The ++ and -- operators are used as in C

     Relational and Boolean Operators
     * ==, !=, >, <, <=, >= are used in comparisons
     * &&, ||, and ! are the Boolean operators
     * Boolean operators are evaluated in short circuit fashion

     Unlike C, Java does not have a comma operator
     * However, you can use a comma-separated list of expressions in the first and third slot of a for
       statement

   Bitwise Operators
     * & ("and"), | ("or"), ^ ("xor"), ~ ("not") are the bitwise operators
     * e.g.,

   int fourthBitFromRight = (foo & 8) / 8;

   gives you a 1 if bit 3 of foo is 1, and 0 if it is 0

     >> and << are the right and left bit shift operators
   int fourthBitFromRight = (foo & (1 << 3)) >>3;

     >> does right shift with sign extension

     >>> does right shift with zero-fill

     (There is no >>> operator in C, and the action of >> is not well defined, so it only works
   correctly for positive integers) Strings
     * Java does not have a built-in string type
     * The standard Java library contains a predefined class called String
     * Each quoted string is an instance of the String class

   String e = "";     // an empty string
       String greeting = "Hello";

   Concatenation
     * Java allows you to use the + sign to concatenate two strings together

        String part1 = "Hello";
        String part2 = "world";
        String message = part1 + part2;

     * The above code makes the value of the string object message "Helloworld"
     * When you concatenate a string with a value that is not a string, the latter is converted to a
       string

   String rating = "PG" + 13;

     * sets rating to the string "PG13"

   Substrings
     * You can extract a substring from a larger string with the substring method of the String class

   String machine = "computer";
       String s = machine.substring(1,4);

     * creates a string consisting of the characters "omp"

     The first argument to substring is the starting position of the substring

     The second argument is the first position that you do not want to copy

     This seems peculiar, but it is easy to compute the length of the substring

     s.substring(a,b) always has length b-a String Editing
     * The length of a string is found by the length method

   String machine = "computer";
       int n = machine.length(); // is 7

     * To edit a string, you need to use the substring method

   String software = machine.substring(0,4)+"il" + machine.substring(6,8)

     * gives us "compiler" in software

   machine = machine.substring(0,1) + machine.substring(4,8);

     * makes the "computer" "cuter"

   Why can't you change characters directly?
     * A Java string is not "just an array of chars"
     * The Java documentation refers to string objects as being immutable -- that is, the string "Hello"
       always contains the sequence 'H','e','l','l','o'
     * You can, however, change the contents of the string variable message and make it refer to a
       different string
     * Although immutable strings seem to be less efficient, they have one great advantage: they can be
       shared

   How string sharing works
     * Think of the various strings as sitting on the heap
     * String variables then point to locations on the heap
     * The substring machine.substring(1,4) is just a pointer to the existing "computer" string,
       together with the range of characters that are used in the substring
     * Overall, the designers of Java decided that the efficiency of string-sharing outweighs the
       inefficiency of immutability

   Further notes on Java strings
     * C programmers sometimes have difficulty adjusting to Java strings, because they think of strings
       as arrays of characters:

   char greeting[] = "Hello";

     * That is the wrong analogy; a better one is

   char *greeting = "Hello";

     * But what happens when we make another assignment to greeting?

   greeting = "Howdy";

     * In C, we would have a memory leak
     * In Java, automatic garbage collection is performed; the unreferenced memory will eventually be
       recycled

   Testing Strings for Equality
     * To test if two strings are equal, use the equals method

   s.equals(t)
       returns true if the strings s and t are equal, false otherwise

     * s and t can be string variables or string constants

   "Hello".equals(greeting)
       is a perfectly legal boolean expression

     * Do not use the == operator to test if two strings are equal

     * == only determines if the strings are stored in the same location

   Comparing Strings
     * The compareTo method is the exact analog of strcmp in C
     * You can use

   if (greeting.compareTo("Hello") == 0)

   (although it seems clearer to use equals instead)
     * compareTo has the heading

   int compareTo(String other)

     * returns a negative value if the string comes before other in Unicode order, a positive value if
       the string comes after other, or 0 if the strings are equal

   Useful methods from java.lang.String
   char charAt(int index)

     * returns the character at the specified location

   boolean endsWith(String suffix)

     * returns true if the string ends with suffix

   boolean startsWith(String prefix)

     * returns true if the string ends with prefix

   boolean equalsIgnoreCase(String other)

     * returns true if the string equals other, except for upper/lowercase distinction

   int indexOf(String str)
       int indexOf(String str, int fromIndex)

     * returns the start of the first substring equal to str, starting at index 0 or at fromIndex

   int lastIndexOf(String str)
       int lastIndexOf(String str, int fromIndex)

     * returns the start of the last substring equal to str, starting at index 0 or at fromIndex

   String replace(char oldChar, char newChar)

     * returns a new string that is obtained by replacing all characters oldChar in the string with
       newChar

   String toLowerCase()

     * returns a new string containing all characters in the original string, with uppercase characters
       converted to lowercase

   String toUpperCase()

     * returns a new string containing all characters in the original string, with lowercase characters
       converted to uppercase

   String trim()

     * returns a new string by eliminating all leading and trailing spaces in the original string

   Control Flow
     * Java control flow constructs are very similar to those of C and C++, with a few minor exceptions
     * We will emphasize what the exceptions are
     * Java has no goto, but it does have a "labeled" version of break that you can use to break out of
       a nested loop (about the only place where a goto should be used anyway)

   Block Scope
     * A block (or compound statement) is a sequence of statements enclosed in curly braces
     * A block allows you to use multiple statements as a unit
     * In Java, unlike C, it not possible to declare identically named variables in two nested blocks

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int n;

        {
            int k;
            int n; // error -- can't redefine n in inner block
        }
    }
   
   Conditional Statements
     * if and if-else statements are identical to those of C/C++
     * Because of the short-circuit boolean expression evaluation built-in to Java,

   if (x !=0 && 1/x > 0) // no division by zero
       does not evaluate 1/x if x is zero, and so cannot lead to a divide-by-zero error

     * Java also supports the ternary ? operator

   condition ? e1 : e2

   Looping Structures
     * The while loop does the test at the top, just as it does in C
     * The do-while does the test at the bottom, also as in C
     * The for loop is used for counter-controlled loops, as in C
     * Be careful about testing for equality of floating-point numbers

     * A for loop that looks like this:

   for(x = 0; x! = 10; x += 0.01)

   may never end (due to roundoff errors, the value 10.0 is not reached exactly)

   Multi-way selection
     * ifs may be nested, or you may use the switch statement in Java
     * Unfortunately, the switch is as limited in Java as it is in C
     * You may only select on a char or any integer type (except long) and you cannot use a range of
       values
     * You still must use the break at the end of each case (unless you want to fall through into the
       next case)

   Labeled Breaks
     * goto is a reserved word in Java, but it is not used in any legal statement
     * The only real reason for goto is to jump out of a nested loop upon an error condition
     * The labeled break adds this capability without opening up the possibility of "spaghetti code"

   Labeled break example
   stop: while(...)
       {

   for (...)
       {    . . .

   if (error_condition)

   break stop; // jump out of the loop labeled stop

   . . . } }
     * Note that the label must precede the outermost loop out of which you want to break
     * There is also a labeled continue, but it is of dubious utility

   Class Methods
   (User-Defined Functions)
     * Method is the "new and improved" terminology for function
     * A method definition must occur inside a class
     * It can occur anywhere inside the class, although (unlike C) Java custom places all the other
       methods of a class before the main method
     * Also unlike C, Java does not have "global" functions
     * Static methods do not operate on objects and so are the same as normal C functions

   An Example: Lottery Odds
     * If you must match six numbers from the numbers 1 to 50 then there are (50· 49· 48· 46· 45)/(1· 2·
       3· 4· 5· 6) possible outcomes, so your chance is 1 in 15,890,700 (good luck! or rather fat
       chance!)
     * Just in case someone wants you to participate in a pick k out of n lottery, here is a method to
       compute the odds:

    public static long lotteryOdds(int n, int k) {
        long r = 1;
        int i;
        for (i = 1; i <= k; i++) {
            r = r * n / i;
            n--;
        }
    return r;
    }
   
   Calling the Method
     * See [2]Lottery.java
     * This application uses the Java Swing API which we will cover later (because doing raw input in
       Java is a bearcat -- not to be confused with a BearKat, of course )

   Comments on Methods
     * Methods in Java are similar but not identical to functions in C++
     * There is no analog to C++ function prototypes in Java
     * They are not required because methods can be defined after they are used -- the compiler makes
       multiple passes through the code
     * Pointer and reference arguments do not exist in Java -- you cannot pass the location of a
       variable

   Class Variables
     * Occasionally, it is useful to declare a variable that will be accessible by all the methods in a
       class
     * This is not quite the same as a global variable because it has class scope rather than global
       scope
     * Class variables are declared like class constants, outside any method:

public class Employee {

    private static double socialSecurityRate = 0.0775;
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        . . .
    }
}
   
   Recursion
     * Recursion is a general method of solving problems by reducing them to simpler problems of a
       similar type
     * The general framework for a recursive solution to a problem looks like this:

    solve_recursively(Problem P) {
        if (P is trivial) return the obvious answer;
    
        P1 = simpler problem;
        S1 = solve_recursively(P1);
        S = solution of P using the solution S1
        return S;
    }
    
    Recursion Example
        * Factorial function
    
        * n! = n * (n-1)! n > 0
        * 0! = 1
    
    public static long factorial(int n) {
    
        if ( n <= 1 ) // trivial case
            return 1;
        else
            return n * factorial(n-1);
    }
   
   Arrays
     * In Java, unlike C, arrays are "first-class" objects
     * You are better off not thinking about how arrays are implemented in Java -- just accept them as
       objects that exist in and of themselves
     * You can assign one array to another (but then both array variables refer to the same array
     * Once you create an array, you cannot change its size easily
     * If you need to change the size dynamically, you can use a Java vector object (discussed later)

   Creation of Arrays
     * Arrays are the first example of objects whose creation must be explicitly handled by the
       programmer
     * This is usually done through the new operator:

   int [] arrayOfInt = new int[100];

     * sets up an array that can hold 100 integers
     * The array entries are numbered from 0 to 99

   Range Checking
     * If you try to access the 101st element of a 100 element array, your source code will compile
       without an error or warning
     * Your program will stop when it attempts to access any array element that goes outside the
       declared bounds of the array
