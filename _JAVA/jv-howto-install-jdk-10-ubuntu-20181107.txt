How to install JDK 10 under Ubuntu?

How do I install Java Development Kit (JDK) 10 on Ubuntu?
The installation instructions on Oracle's help center only explain how to download and extract the archive on
Linux platform, without any system setup.

***
Update: JDK 11 Now Available

sudo apt-get install openjdk-11-jdk

***
For JDK 10

Option 1: Easy Installation (PPA)
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:linuxuprising/java
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install oracle-java10-installer

Then set as default with:
sudo apt-get install oracle-java10-set-default

And finally verify Installation with:
$ java -version
java version "10.0.1" 2018-04-17
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment 18.3 (build 10.0.1+10)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM 18.3 (build 10.0.1+10, mixed mode)

Option 2: Manual Installation
  - Download OpenJDK 10 binaries for Linux.
  - Untar the downloaded archive:
    tar xzvf openjdk-10_linux-x64_bin.tar.gz

  - Move the extracted archive to where your system keeps your installed JDKs:
    sudo mv jdk-10 /usr/lib/jvm/java-10-openjdk-amd64/

  - Add the new Java alternative:
    sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/java java /usr/lib/jvm/java-10-openjdk-amd64/bin/java 1
    sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/javac javac /usr/lib/jvm/java-10-openjdk-amd64/bin/javac 1

  - Update your system's java alternatives and choose JDK 10:
    $ sudo update-alternatives --config java
    here are 3 choices for the alternative java (providing /usr/bin/java).

      Selection    Path                                            Priority   Status
    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      0            /usr/lib/jvm/java-9-openjdk-amd64/bin/java       1091      auto mode
    * 1            /usr/lib/jvm/java-10-openjdk-amd64/bin/java      1         manual mode
      2            /usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64/jre/bin/java   1081      manual mode
      3            /usr/lib/jvm/java-9-openjdk-amd64/bin/java       1091      manual mode

    Press <enter> to keep the current choice[*], or type selection number:

    and

    $ sudo update-alternatives --config javac
    There are 3 choices for the alternative javac (providing /usr/bin/javac).

      Selection    Path                                          Priority   Status
    ------------------------------------------------------------
    * 0            /usr/lib/jvm/java-9-openjdk-amd64/bin/javac    1091      auto mode
      1            /usr/lib/jvm/java-10-openjdk-amd64/bin/javac   1         manual mode
      2            /usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64/bin/javac    1081      manual mode
      3            /usr/lib/jvm/java-9-openjdk-amd64/bin/javac    1091      manual mode

    Press <enter> to keep the current choice[*], or type selection number: 1
    update-alternatives: using /usr/lib/jvm/java-10-openjdk-amd64/bin/javac to provide /usr/bin/javac (javac)
    in manual mode

  - Verify your installation with:

    $ java --version
    openjdk 10 2018-03-20
    OpenJDK Runtime Environment 18.3 (build 10+46)
    OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM 18.3 (build 10+46, mixed mode)

    and

    $ javac --version
    javac 10

  - Done
  
If you prefer Oracle's JDK, download it and follow the installation steps as shown above.

***
Note: You need update-alternatives only if you have multiple java versions.
Note: You can purge everything about Java before fresh installing new Java.
 sudo apt purge java*

For Java 10 fresh installation
 1. Download JDK 10 from here (you can download JRE and server JRE): http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/
    javase/downloads/index.html
 2. Extract and put somewhere in /opt/java directory. You putting JDK in /opt/java directory makes it will be
    usable for all users as it is being in the public /opt directory.

    (Note: I downloaded JDK, JRE, and server JRE, and extracted JDK and renamed extracted the folder to
    jdk10, extracted JRE and renamed extracted the folder to jre10, and extracted server JRE and renamed
    extracted the folder to jre10server as shown in below snapshot).

 3. Update your /etc/environment file as below enter image description here
        JDK_HOME = "/opt/java/jdk10"
        JRE_HOME = "/opt/java/jre10"
        JRE_SERVER_HOME = "/opt/java/jre10server"
        JAVA_HOME = "/opt/java/jdk10"
        JDK_HOME = "/opt/java/jdk10"
        
        PATH="${JDK_HOME}/bin:${JRE_HOME}/bin:${JRE_SERVER_HOME}/bin:${JAVA_HOME}/bin:$PATH"

Now, you need to reload the /etc/environment script file into the system using source command as below.
source /etc/environment

enter image description here

***
The advantage is you dont give control to os to install stuff and if you want to switch between JDK versions,
you can do that very easily. Steps :-

Step 1- Download JDK and Extract it
Step 2- Move your extracted folder in a proper directory of your choice.
Step 3- Set environment variable as we do in Windows System Update your .bashrc file and add the following
line:
export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/java/jdk1.8.0_77
export PATH="$PATH:$JAVA_HOME/bin"

***
You need to do update-alternatives --install before the final step.

sudo update-alternatives --install "/usr/bin/java" java "/usr/lib/jvm/java-10-openjdk-amd64/bin/java" 1
sudo update-alternatives --install "/usr/bin/javac" javac "/usr/lib/jvm/java-10-openjdk-amd64/bin/javac" 1
