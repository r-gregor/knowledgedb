How To Set Java Default Version On Debian/Ubuntu
August 26, 2019

     This comprehensive Linux guide expects that you run the following commands as root user but if you
     decide to run the commands as a different user then ensure that the user has sudo access and that
     you precede each of the privileged commands with sudo

   You can use multiple versions of java on your linux system for development and different software
   requirements.
   In this tutorial, we will guide you about switching between different versions of java using command
   line in Debian/Ubuntu.

Displaying Available Versions
   To display the list of available versions of the java installed on your system, you can run the
   following command
root@codesposts:~$ update-java-alternatives --list

java-1.11.0-openjdk-amd64      1111       /usr/lib/jvm/java-1.11.0-openjdk-amd64
java-12-oracle                 1091       /usr/lib/jvm/java-12-oracle

Switching Java Default Version
   You can switch between different versions of java installed on your system by running the following
   command on your system.
root@codesposts:~$ update-alternatives --config java

There are 2 choices for the alternative java (providing /usr/bin/java).

  Selection    Path                                         Priority   Status
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  0            /usr/lib/jvm/java-11-openjdk-amd64/bin/java   1111      auto mode
  1            /usr/lib/jvm/java-11-openjdk-amd64/bin/java   1111      manual mode
* 2            /usr/lib/jvm/java-12-oracle/bin/java          1091      manual mode

Press <enter> to keep the current choice[*], or type selection number:2

   Enter the number of the desired java version and press ENTER.

Verifying Version
   You can verify the default version of Java on your system by running the following command on your
   system.
root@codesposts:~$ java --version

java 12.0.2 2019-07-16
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 12.0.2+10)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 12.0.2+10, mixed mode, sharing)

Setting Default Version Of javac
   You can follow the same steps to set the default version of javac on your system.
root@codesposts:~$ update-alternatives --config javac

There is 1 choice for the alternative javac (providing /usr/bin/javac).

  Selection    Path                                   Priority   Status

Press <enter> to keep the current choice[*], or type selection number:

Setting Environment Variables
   You can run the following commands to set the environment variables for java.
root@codesposts:~$ export JAVA_HOME=$(readlink -f /usr/bin/java | sed "s:bin/java::")

root@codesposts:~$ export JAVA_HOME=$(readlink -f /usr/bin/java | sed "s:jre/bin/java::")
