How to Install Gradle on Debian 9
March 3, 2019

   Gradle is a general-purpose build tool used primarily for Java projects, combining the best features
   of Ant and [15]Maven. Unlike its predecessors which use XML for scripting, Gradle uses [16]Groovy, a
   dynamic, object-oriented programming language for the Java platform to define the project and build
   scripts.

   In this tutorial, we will explain how to install Gradle on Debian 9.

Prerequisites
   You’ll need to be logged in as a user with sudo access to be able to install packages on your
   Debian system.

Installing Gradle on Debian
   In the following sections, we will provide step-by-step instructions for downloading and installing
   the latest Gradle version on Debian 9.

1. Install OpenJDK
   Gradle requires Java JDK or JRE version 7 or above to be installed.

   We’ll install OpenJDK 8:
sudo apt update
sudo apt install openjdk-8-jdk

   Verify the Java installation by running:
java -version

   The output should look something like this:
openjdk version "1.8.0_181"
OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_181-8u181-b13-2~deb9u1-b13)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.181-b13, mixed mode)

   If you prefer Oracle Java over OpenJDK follow [18]these instructions to install Oracle Java.

2. Download Gradle
   At the time of writing this article, the latest version of Gradle is 5.2.1. Before continuing with
   the next step you should check the [19]Gradle releases page to see if a newer version is available.

   Downloading the Gradle Binary-only zip file in the /tmp directory using the following [20]wget
   command:
wget https://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-5.2.1-bin.zip -P /tmp

   Once the download is completed, [21]extract the zip file in the /opt/gradle directory:
sudo unzip -d /opt/gradle /tmp/gradle-*.zip

   Verify that the Gradle files are extracted by listing the /opt/gradle/gradle-5.0 directory:
ls /opt/gradle/gradle-5.2.1

bin  getting-started.html  init.d  lib  LICENSE  media  NOTICE

3. Setup environment variables
   Next, we’ll need to configure the PATH environment variable to include the Gradle bin directory. To
   do so, open your text editor and create a new file named gradle.sh inside of the /etc/profile.d/
   directory.
sudo nano /etc/profile.d/gradle.sh

   Paste the following configuration:
export GRADLE_HOME=/opt/gradle/gradle-5.0
export PATH=${GRADLE_HOME}/bin:${PATH}

   Save and close the file. This script will be sourced at shell startup.

   Make the script executable by typing:
sudo chmod +x /etc/profile.d/gradle.sh

   Load the environment variables using the following command:
source /etc/profile.d/gradle.sh

4. Verify the Gradle installation
   To validate that Gradle is installed properly use the gradle -v command which will display the Gradle
   version:
gradle -v

   You should see something like the following:
Welcome to Gradle 5.2.1!

Here are the highlights of this release:
 - Define sets of dependencies that work together with Java Platform plugin
 - New C++ plugins with dependency management built-in
 - New C++ project types for gradle init
 - Service injection into plugins and project extensions
