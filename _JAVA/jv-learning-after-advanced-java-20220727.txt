What can I start learning after advanced Java?

Advanced building real applications to a pro standard.

The kind of mix of things I look for is good use of:
    CI CD pipeline
    TDD
    good design/SOLID/functional
    test pyramid
    trunk based development
    clean code
    appropriate scalability
    owasp security
    source control
    Good API design

That's the journey I went on after getting decent with small programs.
More the process of getting code that is easy for a team to work with
and in an agile state.
