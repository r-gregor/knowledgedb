Can you amaze me with a Java trick?

- Easy way of swapping two numbers:
// A quick way to swap a and b 
a ^= b; 
b ^= a; 
a ^= b; 

- Easy way to multiply and divide by two (In Binary)
Multiplying by 2 means shifting all the bits to left and dividing by 2 means shifting to the right.

Example : 2 (Binary 10): shifting left 4 (Binary 100) and right 1 (Binary 1)

n = n << 1;  // Multiply n with 2 

n = n >> 1;  // Divide n by 2

- Calculate number of digits without using a loop:
1No. of digits in N = Math.floor(Math.log10(N)) + 1;

- checking for a prime number: Java has inbuilt isProbablePrime() method in BigInteger Class. It returns true
if this BigInteger is probably prime(with some certainty), false if it’s definitely composite.
1BigInteger.valueOf(1235).isProbablePrime(1)

- Merge two hash tables
Map m1 = …;
Map m2 = …;
m2.putAll(m1); // adds all elements of m1 to m2

- Use of ternary conditional operators:
if (a > b) {
    result = x;
} else {
    result = y;
}

is the same as
result = a > b ? x : y;

- Check if a number is odd (not using modulus):
public boolean oddOrNot(int num) {
 return (num & 1) != 0;
}
