How to round of Numbers in Java
20.05.2022

   Java provides a built-in class known as Math class which belongs to the java.lang package. The
   java.lang.Math class provides numerous methods that are used to perform different numeric operations
   such as rounding of a number, finding square root, and so on. The Math class offers multiple methods
   to round off a number such as round(), ceil(), floor().

   This article will provide a profound knowledge about how to round of numbers in java. In this
   write-up we will cover the below listed method to round of a number in java:
     * What is Math.round() and how to use it in Java
     * What is Math.ceil() and how to use it in Java
     * What is Math.floor() and how to use it in Java

   So, let's get started!

What is Math.round() and how to use it in Java
   It is a predefined method of Java's Math class that cuts off the floating value and returns the
   closest integer-type number.

   Example
   This example will assist you to understand how to use the Math.round() method in java:

public class RoundingOfNumber {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		float number1 = 172.52f;
		double number2 = 172.12;
		float number3 = 10.12f;
		float number4 = 10.72f;
		double number5 = -570.82;

		System.out.println("Rounding of 172.52: " + Math.round(number1));
		System.out.println("Rounding of 172.12: " + Math.round(number2));
		System.out.println("Rounding of 10.12: " + Math.round(number3));
		System.out.println("Rounding of 10.72: " + Math.round(number4));
		System.out.println("Rounding of -570.82: " + Math.round(number5));
	}
}

   Above program will produce the following output:

 $> javac RoundingOfNumber.java && java RoundingOfNumber
Rounding of 172.52: 173
Rounding of 172.12: 172
Rounding of 10.12: 10
Rounding of 10.72: 11
Rounding of -570.82: -571

What is Math.ceil() and how to use it in Java

   It is a predefined method of Java's Math class that rounds the given number upward and returns the
   double-type value; the below-given example will provide you more clarity on this concept.

   Example
   We will modify the previous example and instead of Math.round() method we will utilize the
   Math.ceil() method:

public class RoundingOfNumber {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		float number1 = 172.52f;
		double number2 = 172.12;
		float number3 = 10.12f;
		float number4 = 10.72f;
		double number5 = -570.82;

		System.out.println("Rounding of 172.52: " + Math.ceil(number1));
		System.out.println("Rounding of 172.12: " + Math.ceil(number2));
		System.out.println("Rounding of 10.12: " + Math.ceil(number3));
		System.out.println("Rounding of 10.72: " + Math.ceil(number4));
		System.out.println("Rounding of -570.82: " + Math.ceil(number5));
	}
}

   On successful execution of the program, we will get the following output:

 $> javac RoundingOfNumber.java && java RoundingOfNumber
Rounding of 172.52: 173.0
Rounding of 172.12: 173.0
Rounding of 10.12: 11.0
Rounding of 10.72: 11.0
Rounding of -570.82: -570.0

What is Math.floor() and how to use it in Java
   This method opposes the concept of Math.ceil() method i.e. it rounds the given number downward and
   returns the double-type value.

   Example
   Let's consider the below-given program to understand the working of the Math.floor() method.
public class RoundingOfNumber {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		float number1 = 172.52f;
		double number2 = 172.12;
		float number3 = 10.12f;
		float number4 = 10.72f;
		double number5 = -570.82;

		System.out.println("Rounding of 172.52: " + Math.floor(number1));
		System.out.println("Rounding of 172.12: " + Math.floor(number2));
		System.out.println("Rounding of 10.12: " + Math.floor(number3));
		System.out.println("Rounding of 10.72: " + Math.floor(number4));
		System.out.println("Rounding of -570.82: " + Math.floor(number5));
	}
}

   On successful execution of the above given code, we will get the following output:

 $> javac RoundingOfNumber.java && java RoundingOfNumber
Rounding of 172.52: 172.0
Rounding of 172.12: 172.0
Rounding of 10.12: 10.0
Rounding of 10.72: 10.0
Rounding of -570.82: -571.0

Conclusion
   The Math class provides three methods to round off a number i.e. round(), ceil(), floor(). The
   math.round() method cuts off the floating value and returns the closest integer-type number. The
   ceil() method rounds the given number upward and returns the double-type value while the floor()
   method rounds the given number downward and returns the double-type value. This write-up explained
   the working of three built-in methods to round off a number in java i.e. round(), ceil(), and
   floor().
