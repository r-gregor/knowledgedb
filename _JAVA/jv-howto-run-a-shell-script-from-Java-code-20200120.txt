How do I run a shell script from Java code?

***
   There are two methods that work generally well depending on what kind of flexibility you need within
   your code and for the script you need to call. Here are examples:
String[] cmdScript = new String[]{"/bin/bash", "path/to/myScript.sh"};
Process procScript = Runtime.getRuntime().exec(cmdScript);

   If you only need to call your script without any other parameters, that is the most direct method.
   Although you can add parameters directly after that name of the script if needed, complex parameters
   (spaces, special characters, etc) can cause formatting issues and lead to bugs.

   If you want to be able to debug easier and keep your parameters separate, you can use the ProcessBuilder class,
   something like:
Process procBuildScript = new ProcessBuilder("path/to/myScript.sh", "myArg1 myArg2").start();
