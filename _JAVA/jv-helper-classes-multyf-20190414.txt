What are helper objects in java?

   I come across few of the times called helper objects... can anybody elaborate what are
   those helper objects and why do we need them?

***
   Some operations which are common to a couple of classes can be moved to helper classes,
   which are then used via object composition:
public class OrderService {
    private PriceHelper priceHelper = new PriceHelper();

    public double calculateOrderPrice(order) {
        double price = 0;
        for (Item item : order.getItems()) {
            double += priceHelper.calculatePrice(item.getProduct());
        }
    }
}

public class ProductService {
    private PriceHelper priceHelper = new PriceHelper();

    public double getProductPrice(Product product) {
        return priceHelper.calculatePrice(product);
    }
}

   Using helper classes can be done in multiple ways:
     * Instantiating them directly (as above)
     * via dependency injection
     * by making their methods static and accessing them in a static way, like
       IOUtils.closeQuietly(inputStream) closes an InputStream wihtout throwing exceptions.
     * at least my convention is to name classes with only static methods and not dependencies
       XUtils, and classees that in turn have dependencies / need to be managed by a DI
       container XHelper

   (The example above is just a sample - it shouldn't be discussed in terms of Domain Driven
   Design)

***
   These are objects that "sit to the side" of the main body of code, and do some of the work
   for the object. They "help" the object to do it's job.

   As an example, many people have a Closer helper object. This will take various closeable
   objects, for example, java.sql.Statement, java.sql.Connection, etc and will close the
   object, and ignore any errors that come out of it. This tends to be because if you get an
   error closing an object, there is not much you can do about it anyway, so people just
   ignore it.

   Rather than having this boilerplate:
try {
  connection.close();
} catch (SQLException e) {
  // just ignore... what can you do when you can't close the connection?
   log.warn("couldn't close connection", e);
}

... scattered around the codebase, they simply call:
Closer.close(connection);

... instead. For example, look at guava [44]closeQuietly.

***
   A 'helper' method is typically a method to make something easier, whatever it is. Sometimes
   they're used to make things more readable/clearly organized (some may argue this, but it's
   ultimately very subjective):
public void doStuff() {
   wakeUp();
   drinkCoffee();
   drive();
   work();
   goHome();
}

   Where, each 'helper method' on their own are fairly complex... the concept becomes really
   clear and simple.

   Another very good use of helper methods is to provide common functionality across many
   different classes. The best example of this is the Math class which contains a ton of
   static helper methods to help you calculate things like the log of a number, the exponent
   of a number... etc.

   Where you draw the line as to what's a helper method and what's just a regular method is
   pretty subjective, but that's the gist of it. Other answers here are pretty good too.

***
   Helper class, in my opinion, is similar to normal functions declared outside of classes in
   C++. For example, if you need a global constant for many classes, then you can define a
   helper class that encloses a final static const variable.

            System.out.print(prompt);
            String s = input.nextLine();
            // Convert string input to integer
            try {
                ans = Integer.parseInt(s);
                if (ans >= lowerBound && ans <= upperBound) {
                    inputValid = true;
                } else {
                     inputValid = false;
                }
            } catch (Exception e) {
                inputValid = false;
            }
       } while (!inputValid);
       return ans;
   }
}

   that is an example of of a Helper Class. It contains method which of are common use of the
   other classes in the project.

   Example if someone wants to enter an Integer number from a class hew ill have to type in
   this: String num = Helpers.getIntegerInput("input your number");

   The prompt is the output that is show to the user. Other examples to input a String,
   double, date and time etc.

*** (5+)
   You can see a helper class as a toolbox that can be used by other classes to perform task
   like testing if a string is a palindrome, if a given number is prime, if an array contains
   negative number etc. You can create helper class by making all its methods static and its
   constructor private, and optionally you can also make the class final. Thus it can not be
   instantiated and one can easily access to all its methods directly.

public final class HelperClass{

       private HelperClass(){
       }

       public static boolean isPositive(int number) {

             if (number >= 0)
                    return true;
             else
                    return false;
       }
}

   Here the function can be use directly to test a number :
 HelperClass.isPositive(5);

Java | How to create your own Helper Class?

   Helper Class is a Java class which includes basic error handling, some helper functions
   etc. Helper class contains functions that help in assisting the program. This Class intends
   to give quick implementation of basic functions such that programmers do not have to
   implement again and again. It is easy to Access as all the member functions are static that
   is it can be accessed from anywhere. It implements the most commonly used functions
   excluding the functions that are already present in java library.

   Different helper class contains different methods depending upon the need of the program.

   Recommendation : Make a package for this class naming HelperClass and import in your java
   code

@UtilityClass

Utility, metility, wetility! Utility classes for the masses.

   @UtilityClass was introduced as an experimental feature in lombok v1.16.2.

Experimental
   Experimental because:
     * Some debate as to whether its common enough to count as boilerplate.

   Current status: positive - Currently we feel this feature may move out of experimental
   status with no or minor changes soon.

Overview
   A utility class is a class that is just a namespace for functions. No instances of it can
   exist, and all its members are static. For example, java.lang.Math and
   java.util.Collections are well known utility classes. This annotation automatically turns
   the annotated class into one.

   A utility class cannot be instantiated. By marking your class with @UtilityClass, lombok
   will automatically generate a private constructor that throws an exception, flags as error
   any explicit constructors you add, and marks the class final. If the class is an inner
   class, the class is also marked static.

   All members of a utility class are automatically marked as static. Even fields and inner
   classes.

With Lombok
   import lombok.experimental.UtilityClass;
   @UtilityClass
   public class UtilityClassExample {
     private final int CONSTANT = 5;
     public int addSomething(int in) {
       return in + CONSTANT;
     }
   }

Vanilla Java
   public final class UtilityClassExample {
     private static final int CONSTANT = 5;
     private UtilityClassExample() {
       throw new java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException("This is a utility class and cannot be instantiated");
     }

     public static int addSomething(int in) {
       return in + CONSTANT;
     }
   }

Supported configuration keys:
   lombok.utilityClass.flagUsage = [warning | error] (default: not set)

Lombok will flag any usage of @UtilityClass as a warning or error if configured.

Small print
   There isn't currently any way to create non-static members, or to define your own
   constructor. If you want to instantiate the utility class, even only as an internal
   implementation detail, @UtilityClass cannot be used.

https://dzone.com/articles/why-do-we-still-create-util-classes

Why Do We Still Create Util Classes?

Utils can be handy, but they're largely unnecessary. Stick with Apache Commons or Guava and only
create utils when you really need to.

   It's been niggling at me for a while, a few years even, but why do we insist on creating
   our own util classes like StringUtils, DateUtils, or CollectionUtils when we have great
   open source projects that contain these classes and methods? In fact, recently, I foolishly
   created a CSVUtil class instead of using Apache Commons CSV or OpenCSV.

   The most common method you see is a StringUtil.isNullOrEmpty. It will be similar to this:
public static boolean isNullOrEmpty(String myString) {
  if (myString == null || "".equals(myString)) {
    return true;
  } else {
    return false;
  }
}

   It's not bad code, and it keeps you DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) from repeated null or empty
   string checks.

   But there are some problems:
     * Reinventing the wheel because there are a lot of great libraries providing this util
       and more.
     * Created an artifact that you need to support and write unit tests for.
     * Impact on code coverage – if you don't unit test, then you get a black mark against
       your code coverage.
     * Chance you have introduced a bug.

   One reason we see code like this is that they are an organizational software legacy,
   whereas, in the pre-Java8 world, we checked for null - we didn't have Optional classes.

What to Use Instead?
     * [http://commons.apache.org/] Apache Commons: In my experience, this is the most common set of utilities,
       and they probably closely match the util they would replace
     * [https://github.com/google/guava] Google Guava: These are newer than Apache Commons, although are now well
       established. The approach is slightly different and allow you to method chain. This might suit your
       coding style better

Selection
   The choice of library isn't as important as consistency – so try not to mix Apache Commons
   in one part of the code with the Guava implementation in another part of the code. This
   will make future maintenance easier

Caveat
   As with all the best rules, there are times when you need to break them. I would create a
   util class when:
     * Specific implementation: The package I'm using doesn't contain the method I need, but I
       would try to use the existing util as the basis for this.
     * Pre-Java8: I might create a util as a facade on, say, Date's or because I don't have
       Optional.
     * Procrastination: The final reason for creating the util is to procrastinate and avoid
       my main task! I create the util then at least I can feel productive at my next standup.

   So my New Year's resolution for 2017 is to stop creating these classes and use tried and
   tested utils, and try and replace them when I see them!

OOP Alternative to Utility Classes

   A utility class (aka helper class) is a "structure" that has only static methods and
   encapsulates no state. StringUtils, IOUtils, FileUtils from [37]Apache Commons; Iterables
   and Iterators from [38]Guava, and [39]Files from JDK7 are perfect examples of utility
   classes.

   This design idea is very popular in the Java world (as well as C#, Ruby, etc.) because
   utility classes provide common functionality used everywhere.

   Here, we want to follow the [D]on't [R]epeate [Y]ourself - DRY principle and avoid duplication.
   Therefore, we place common code blocks into utility classes and reuse them when necessary:
// This is a terrible design, don't reuse
public class NumberUtils {
  public static int max(int a, int b) {
    return a > b ? a : b;
  }
}

   Indeed, this a very convenient technique!?

Utility Classes Are Evil
   However, in an object-oriented world, utility classes are considered a very bad (some even
   may say "terrible") practice.

   There have been many discussions of this subject; to name a few: [41]Are Helper Classes
   Evil? by Nick Malik, [42]Why helper, singletons and utility classes are mostly bad by Simon
   Hart, [43]Avoiding Utility Classes by Marshal Ward, [44]Kill That Util Class! by Dhaval
   Dalal, [45]Helper Classes Are A Code Smell by Rob Bagby.

   Additionally, there are a few questions on StackExchange about utility classes: [46]If a
   "Utilities" class is evil, where do I put my generic code?, [47]Utility Classes are Evil.

   A dry summary of all their arguments is that utility classes are not proper objects;
   therefore, they don't fit into object-oriented world. They were inherited from procedural
   programming, mostly because we were used to a functional decomposition paradigm back then.

   Assuming you agree with the arguments and want to stop using utility classes, I'll show by
   example how these creatures can be replaced with proper [48]objects.

Procedural Example
   Say, for instance, you want to read a text file, split it into lines, trim every line and
   then save the results in another file. This is can be done with [49]FileUtils from Apache
   Commons:
void transform(File in, File out) {
  Collection<String> src = FileUtils.readLines(in, "UTF-8");
  Collection<String> dest = new ArrayList<>(src.size());
  for (String line : src) {
    dest.add(line.trim());
  }
  FileUtils.writeLines(out, dest, "UTF-8");
}

   The above code may look clean; however, this is procedural programming, not
   object-oriented. We are manipulating data (bytes and bits) and explicitly instructing the
   computer from where to retrieve them and then where to put them on every single line of
   code. We're defining a procedure of execution.

Object-Oriented Alternative
   In an object-oriented paradigm, we should instantiate and compose objects, thus letting
   them manage data when and how they desire. Instead of calling supplementary static
   functions, we should create objects that are capable of exposing the behavior we are
   seeking:
public class Max implements Number {
  private final int a;
  private final int b;
  public Max(int x, int y) {
    this.a = x;
    this.b = y;
  }
  @Override
  public int intValue() {
    return this.a > this.b ? this.a : this.b;
  }
}

   This procedural call:
int max = NumberUtils.max(10, 5);

   Will become object-oriented:
int max = new Max(10, 5).intValue();

   Potato, potato? Not really; just read on...

Objects Instead of Data Structures
   This is how I would design the same file-transforming functionality as above but in an
   object-oriented manner:
void transform(File in, File out) {
  Collection<String> src = new Trimmed(
    new FileLines(new UnicodeFile(in))
  );
  Collection<String> dest = new FileLines(
    new UnicodeFile(out)
  );
  dest.addAll(src);
}

   FileLines implements Collection<String> and encapsulates all file reading and writing
   operations. An instance of FileLines behaves exactly as a collection of strings and hides
   all I/O operations. When we iterate it-a file is being read. When we addAll() to it-a file
   is being written.

   Trimmed also implements Collection<String> and encapsulates a collection of strings
   ([50]Decorator pattern). Every time the next line is retrieved, it gets trimmed.

   All classes taking participation in the snippet are rather small: Trimmed, FileLines, and
   UnicodeFile. Each of them is responsible for its own single feature, thus following
   perfectly the [51]single responsibility principle.

   On our side, as users of the library, this may be not so important, but for their
   developers it is an imperative. It is much easier to develop, maintain and unit-test class
   FileLines rather than using a readLines() method in a 80+ methods and 3000 lines utility
   class FileUtils. Seriously, look at [52]its source code.

   An object-oriented approach enables lazy execution. The in file is not read until its data
   is required. If we fail to open out due to some I/O error, the first file won't even be
   touched. The whole show starts only after we call addAll().

   All lines in the second snippet, except the last one, instantiate and compose smaller
   objects into bigger ones. This object composition is rather cheap for the CPU since it
   doesn't cause any data transformations.

   Besides that, it is obvious that the second script runs in O(1) space, while the first one
   executes in O(n). This is the consequence of our procedural approach to data in the first
   script.

   In an object-oriented world, there is no data; there are only objects and their behavior!
