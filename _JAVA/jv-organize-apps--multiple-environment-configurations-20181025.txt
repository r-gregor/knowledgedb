Organize applications' multiple environment configurations

   Configuration parameters are the values that allow you to configure the behavior of your applications
   without changing any code. These values control how parts of the application look or act. String
   messages, IP addresses, user interface layout measures, and the maximum number of objects in cache
   memory are sample configuration parameters commonly found in software applications.

   Property files and XML document files are often used to organize application configuration
   parameters. Usually these configuration files are read by an application when it first starts up. A
   property file contains a set of strings, where properties are stated with the syntax name=value. On
   the other hand, XML document files, when used as configuration files, provide configuration
   parameters in an XML element <name>value</name> syntax. The following are sample configuration
   parameters displayed as a property file and as an XML configuration file.

   Sample author.properties configuration file
 name.first=paulo
name.last=caroli
url=www.caroli.org

   Sample author.xml configuration file
 <?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1" ?>
<author>
    <name>
        <first>paulo</first>
        <last>caroli</last>
    </name>
    <url>www.caroli.org</url>
</author>


   In simplistic application development, configuration parameters and configuration files are not
   explicitly delineated. In such applications, configuration values are embedded in the application's
   code; these are usually called hard-coded values. Applications containing hard-coded values are
   difficult to alter. To simply change a hard-coded value, the application's code must be altered,
   recompiled, and redeployed. Also, hard-coded values require a developer's expertise. While property
   files can be easily altered by nondevelopers, hard-coded value changes require a developer to locate
   and implement the configuration value changes.

   Using configuration files is highly recommended, but managing configuration parameters grows more
   complicated for applications that execute in several environments. Common in software organizations,
   some applications execute in distinct runtime environments according to the company's development
   phases. In my company, during an application release lifecycle, the application executes in
   development, integration, quality assurance, staging, and production environments. Each environment
   requires different configuration files and values. For example, the maximum number of objects in
   cache memory might be 10,000 in a production environment, while, in a development environment, a much
   lower value is used during alpha tests.

   This article introduces a configuration mechanism, a uniform solution for dealing with all of a Java
   application's configuration parameters regardless of environments. The proposed configuration
   mechanism is composed of three interconnecting parts: configuration folder schema, configuration
   parameter reader, and launch command outline. The figure below illustrates each of the mechanism's
   parts. The following sections address each part.
   [ Learn Java from beginning concepts to advanced design patterns in this comprehensive 12-part
   course! ] [jw-1108-config-thumb-100156577-orig.gif] The parts of the configuration mechanism.

Configuration folder schema
   The proposed configuration folder schema is the structural backbone of the configuration mechanism.
   Java applications are typically deployed in multiple environments and platforms, each requiring some
   unique configuration. Runtime environments inevitably need conflicting settings, and the settings
   might significantly differ according to an environment's specific needs. Examples of
   environment-specific configuration values are: IP addresses, database connectivity, or application
   timing and boundaries values.

   The following is a generic application's configuration folder schema:
 configuration/
    common app configuration files...
    env1/
        env1 specific configuration files...
    env2/
        env2 specific configuration files...
    ...
    envN/
        envN specific configuration files...


   In this article's proposed configuration folder structure, the common environment's configuration
   files are located under the configuration/ folder, whereas the environment-specific configuration
   files are placed under the environment_name/ folder. Each environment available for the application
   must have a respective environment_name folder.

   The configuration folder should be specific for each application. I recommend adding the
   configuration folder to the application folder structure as follows:
 app/
    classes/
    configuration/
    lib/
    src/


   Using one configuration folder per application is preferred over having a common configuration folder
   for several applications so you can individually configure the applications without affecting the
   others.

Configuration parameter reader
   Applications consist of many components, all sharing common configuration data. This section
   introduces ConfigurationReader and Commons Configuration from the Apache Jakarta Project, a
   combination of approaches that gives developers a simple yet powerful tool for accessing their
   applications' configuration data.

   A crucial part of the configuration mechanism is reading the configuration values. Instead of
   developing a new component for reading configuration files, I based the ConfigurationReader
   implementation on an already established configuration-reading library, the Apache Jakarta Project's
   Commons Configuration library.

   Commons Configuration library
   The Commons Configuration library provides a generic configuration interface that enables an
   application to read configuration data from a variety of sources. This library was used in the
   Turbine and Velocity projects (also from the Apache Jakarta Project) before being introduced in the
   Jakarta Commons project. Visit the Commons Configuration Website for more details on this great
   library.

   In a nutshell, the Commons Configuration library provides a Configuration component to use for
   accessing the configuration values. The Configuration component is obtained by a configuration
   factory that initializes the configuration values according to the configuration datasources
   indicated in a configuration definition file—config.xml. The following is the sample configuration
   definition file provided from the Commons Configuration Website:

   Sample config.xml file
 <?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1" ?>
<configuration>
  <properties fileName="usergui.properties"/>
  <xml fileName="gui.xml"/>
  <xml fileName="tables.xml"/>
</configuration>


   ConfigurationReader component
   The ConfigurationReader component encapsulates the access to the environment-specific configuration
   parameters. Based in the configuration mechanism folder structure and the Commons Configuration
   library, ConfigurationReader retrieves the Configuration interface by setting the
   ConfigurationFactory with the proper environment-specific config.xml file.

   To enable the proper ConfigurationReader component functioning, a config.xml file must be added in
   the proposed configuration folder schema for each environment. Below is the previously presented
   configuration folder schema, with the added environment-specific config.xml files:
 app/configuration/
    common app configuration files...
    env1/
        config.xml
        env1 specific configuration files...
    env2/
        config.xml
        env2 specific configuration files...
    ...
    envN/
        config.xml
        envN specific configuration files...


   The code below shows how the ConfigurationReader component retrieves the proper Configuration
   component according to the env system property defined as the JVM system parameter:

   ConfigurationReader.java
 import org.apache.commons.configuration.*;
// The following libraries are required for Apache Commons-Configuration usage:
// commons-configuration, commons-beanutils, commons-collections,
// commons-digester, commons-lang, commons-logging, xerces and dom4j
public class ConfigurationReader {
  Configuration config = null;
  public ConfigurationReader() {}
  public void load() throws ConfigurationReaderException {
    try {
      ConfigurationFactory factory = new ConfigurationFactory();
      factory.setConfigurationFileName(this.getEnvConfigXMLPath());
      config = factory.getConfiguration();
    }
    catch (Exception exc) {
      throw new ConfigurationReaderException(exc.getMessage());
    }
  }
  public Configuration getConfiguration() throws
ConfigurationReaderException {
    if (config == null) {
      load();
    }
    return config;
  }
  private String getEnvConfigXMLPath() {
    StringBuffer srtBuffer = new StringBuffer("configuration/");
    // System env variable is mapped to configuration/[env] folder
    srtBuffer.append(System.getProperty("env"));
    srtBuffer.append("/config.xml");
    return srtBuffer.toString();
  }
}


   Note that the system env property is read at runtime; which lets the same application code execute
   independently of the environment and maintain the proper configuration files' usage.

Launch command outline
   Automatic recognition of the runtime environment allows your application to benefit from the proposed
   configuration folder schema. Such recognition allows the proper reading of the environment-specific
   configuration according to the specific environment_name/ folder.

   You initiate the Java runtime environment by using the java command, which launches a Java
   application by starting a Java runtime environment, launching specified options, and loading the
   specified program. The syntax for starting a Java application is:
  java [options] -jar file.jar [arguments]
   java [options] class [arguments]


   The following arguments are used in the java command:
     * options: Command line options (optional)
     * file.jar: The name of the jar file to invoke
     * class: The name of the class to invoke
     * arguments: The arguments passed to the main function (optional)

   The code below shows the launch command outline for starting an app.jar application in the env1
   environment. The launch command outline marks the JVM with its environment name during the launch
   process. The -D<property_name>=<value> is a standard option supported by the launcher for setting a
   system property.
  java -Denv=env1 -jar app.jar

   At application startup, the -Denv=env1 option sets the env system property with the env1 value.
   Further, your application's launch command must contain the -D env=environment_name option, where
   environment_name is the environment in which the application executes. Please note that
   environment_name in the launch command must match environment_name used in the configuration folder
   structure.

A Hello World sample application
   The HelloConfig sample application illustrates each part of the proposed configuration mechanism.
   HelloConfig basically reads and displays the following properties:
     * Application Hello string
     * Application World string
     * Author first name string
     * Author last name string
     * Author URL string
     * Runtime environment greetings string
     * Runtime environment goodbye string

   These configuration values are organized as follows: hello.properties and author.xml are
   configuration files common for all runtime environments, whereas env.properties are configuration
   files specific to the runtime environment. For the scope of the HelloConfig application, development,
   staging, and production are the available runtime environments. Below are the sample configuration
   files' contents.

   hello.properties
 # environment common properties
sample.hello=hello config-mechanism
sample.world=world


   author.xml
 <?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1" ?>
<author>
    <name>
        <first>paulo</first>
        <last>caroli</last>
    </name>
    <url>www.caroli.org</url>
</author>


   development env.properties
 # environment specific propertiesenv.greetings=yeap app working in the development environment!!!
env.goodbye=adios from the development environment; later dude


   staging env.properties
 # environment specific properties
env.greetings=all looks good in staging.
env.goodbye=staging environment end of execution. bye for now.


   production env.properties
 # environment specific properties
env.greetings=proper execution in production system.
env.goodbye=finalizing hello config system.


   The following sections explain the steps involved in organizing the configuration files, reading the
   configuration data, and packaging and launching the HelloConfig application. This sample's
   development is entirely based on the configuration mechanism proposed in this article.
   helloconfig.jar is available for download from Resources.

HelloConfig configuration folder schema

   The HelloConfig application's configuration folder schema:
 helloconfig/configuration/
    author.xml
    hello.properties
    development/
        config.xml
        env.properties
    staging/
        config.xml
        env.properties
    production/
        config.xml
        env.properties


   In the HelloConfig configuration folder structure, the common environment's configuration files
   hello.properties and author.xml are located under the configuration/ folder, but config.xml and
   env.properties, which are environment-specific files, are accordingly placed under the
   configuration/development, configuration/staging, and configuration/production folders.

   HelloConfig's application structure is as follow:
 helloconfig/
    MANIFEST.MF
    classes/
    configuration/
    lib/
    src/

   Where:
     * helloconfig/MANIFEST.MF is the manifest file for the HelloConfig application. The code below
       shows the helloconfig/MANIFEST.MF listing.
     * helloconfig/classes has the HelloConfig compiled classfiles.
     * helloconfig/configuration has HelloConfig's configuration files.
     * helloconfig/lib has HelloConfig's required libraries (the libraries required for Commons
       Configuration usage).
     * helloconfig/src has HelloConfig's source code files.

   The following jar command creates helloconfig.jar, the executable sample application jar file:

   helloconfig> jar cmf MANIFEST.MF helloconfig.jar -C classes

   The Commons Configuration required libraries have been downloaded from a Maven mirror site and
   placed in the /lib folder. The MANIFEST.MF file lists the classpath required for the HelloConfig
   application and the main class.

   The following listing is the MANIFEST.MF for the helloconfig sample:

   helloconfig/MANIFEST.MF
 Manifest-Version: 1.0
Main-Class: com.helloworld.HelloConfig
Class-Path: ./lib/commons-configuration.jar ./lib/commons-beanutils.jar
./lib/commons-collections.jar ./lib/commons-digester.jar
./lib/commons-lang.jar ./lib/commons-logging.jar ./lib/xercesImpl.jar
./lib/xmlParserAPIs.jar ./lib/dom4j.jar


   Using the manifest file to define the classpath option is preferred over setting the CLASSPATH
   environment variable. This way, you can set the classpath individually for each application without
   affecting other applications and without other applications modifying its value. Also, the manifest
   file keeps valuable information about those libraries required by your application.

HelloConfig configuration parameters reader
   A configuration definition file—config.xml—is required for each HelloConfig environment. Below are
   the config.xml files' contents for each available environment:

   development config.xml
 <?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1" ?>
<configuration>
      <properties fileName="configuration\development\env.properties" />
      <properties fileName="configuration\hello.properties" />
      <dom4j fileName="configuration\author.xml" />
</configuration>


   staging config.xml
 <?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1" ?>
<configuration>
      <properties fileName="configuration\staging\env.properties" />
      <properties fileName="configuration\hello.properties" />
      <dom4j fileName="configuration\author.xml" />
</configuration>


   production config.xml
 <?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1" ?>
<configuration>
      <properties fileName="configuration\production\env.properties" />
      <properties fileName="configuration\hello.properties" />
      <dom4j fileName="configuration\author.xml" />
</configuration>


   In this simplistic Hello World application, HelloConfig is the class reading and displaying the
   configuration values:

   HelloConfig.java
 import com.configmechanism.ConfigurationReader;
import org.apache.commons.configuration.Configuration;
public class HelloConfig{
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    try {
      ConfigurationReader configurationReader
          = new ConfigurationReader();
      Configuration config
          = configurationReader.getConfiguration();
      // Printing environment-specific greetings
      System.out.println(config.getString("env.greetings"));
      // Configuration parameters from hello.properties
      System.out.print(config.getString("sample.hello") + " ");
      System.out.println(config.getString("sample.world"));
      // Configuration parameters from author.xml
      System.out.print("author: ");
      System.out.print(config.getString("name.first") + " ");
      System.out.println(config.getString("name.last"));
      System.out.println(config.getString("url"));
      // Printing environment-specific goodbye
      System.out.println(config.getString("env.goodbye"));
    }
    catch (Exception exc) {
      exc.printStackTrace();
    }
  }
}


HelloConfig launch command outline
   The HelloConfig sample application can be executed in one of its three available
   environments—development, staging, or production. The launch command executes from a folder
   containing the following required resources:
     * /lib: Folder containing the required libraries
     * /configuration: Folder containing the configuration files
     * helloconfig.jar: The executable jar file

   Below is a sequence of commands depicting the execution folder's contents and the launch commands for
   each environment with the respective system output:

   HelloConfig execution
