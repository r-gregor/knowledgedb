It's hard to deny the simple beauty of a function
December 2, 2025

   I love object-oriented programming. I love naming concepts and materializing them with a class. I
   love dot notation. I love hiding implementation behind a seemingly simple accessor. I've always
   leaned a little more on the side of OOP in the holy war against FP.

   But the more code I write, the harder it gets to deny the simple beauty of a function.

     Data in, behavior, data out.

   Everything you need to understand it is at hand; no bouncing around the file to gather the necessary
   context. It's all right there.

   The function is the "aha moment" of learning to program.

   As the years went by, I drifted away from using them because they look naive when put next to
   advanced constructs like classes, meta-programming, design patterns, or inheritance. But a few recent
   experiences might be changing that.

   In Sandy Metz's book [https://sandimetz.com/99bottles]99 Bottles of OOP, she shocks readers with her
   initial implementation of a program to print the lyrics of the famous "99 Bottles of Beer" song.

def verse(number)
	case number
	when 0
		"No more bottles of beer on the wall, " +
		"no more bottles of beer.\n" +
		"Go to the store and buy some more, " +
		"99 bottles of beer on the wall.\n"
	when 1
		"1 bottle of beer on the wall, " +
		"1 bottle of beer.\n" +
		"Take it down and pass it around, " +
		"no more bottles of beer on the wall.\n"
	when 2
		"2 bottles of beer on the wall, " +
		"2 bottles of beer.\n" +
		"Take one down and pass it around, " +
		"1 bottle of beer on the wall.\n"
	else
		"#{number} bottles of beer on the wall, " +
		"#{number} bottles of beer.\n" +
		"Take one down and pass it around, " +
		"#{number-1} bottles of beer on the wall.\n"
	end
end

   Shameless simplicity. I can understand this code instantly. This was her default take and the most
   legible way to write it, even if it broke away from "best practices".

   Just last month at the SF Ruby conference, well-published author Dave Thomas gave his talk about not
   needing the class construct for much of our programs. His point was, unless you need a bunch of
   different instances of a thing, use a function.

# Dave critiques this common ruby style.
EmailService.new(user).send

# And says why not just write it like this.
EmailService.send(user)

   I love when people in authority voice something we all intuitively know, but can't put words to for
   fear of sounding naive.

     It seems we need permission from respected people just to keep things simple.

   And as a Ruby programmer, I've always typed "c" "l" "a" "s" "s" when I wanted to bring something into
   existence. But today I'll pause and see if the simple function might be a better fit.

module Summary
	def self.totals_by_category(scope)
		scope
			.group(:category)
			.sum(:amount)
		# ...
	end
end

   Someone on the internet remixed Michael Pollan's famous advice about eating food, and it might be
   good advice to follow:

   Write code, not too much, mostly functions.
