How to Learn Docker from Scratch: A Guide for Data Professionals
Sep 24, 2024

This guide teaches you how to learn Docker from scratch. Discover practical tips, resources, and a
step-by-step plan to accelerate your learning!

Containerization has transformed how engineering teams manage and scale applications, particularly in
data management, analytics, and machine learning. By packaging applications into isolated and lightweight
environments, containers ensure consistent performance from development to production.

Docker stands out as the most popular solution among the different platforms available. Its flexibility
and simplicity enable data professionals to build reproducible, scalable, and efficient pipelines while
fostering collaboration.

In this article, we'll outline a practical learning plan for Docker, including steps to deploy your
first simple application. Let's dive in!
What is Docker and Why Learning It is Useful?

Docker is an open-source platform that simplifies the deployment, scaling, and management of applications
using containerization.

Containers are lightweight, portable environments that include everything needed to run an application-code,
runtime, libraries, and settings-for consistent performance across different systems. In data projects,
Docker is used to build and manage these containers, allowing applications to run reliably across any
infrastructure.

Unlike virtual machines (VMs), which require their own operating system and a hypervisor to manage them,
Docker virtualizes only the application layer. This results in containers that are faster to start,
less resource-intensive, and easier to configure.

For data professionals, Docker helps create reproducible environments, enabling data pipelines to run
consistently from development to production. It minimizes dependency issues, streamlines workflows,
and fosters team collaboration by providing standardized, shareable environments.

Additionally, Docker integrates with popular data tools like Jupyter, TensorFlow, and Apache Hadoop.

Mastering Docker can boost productivity, optimize workflows, and make your projects scalable and easily
deployable!

Learn Docker from Scratch: Your First Deployment
The best way to learn Docker is by getting hands-on. So, let me guide you through your first simple
deployment. After this, we will explore learning plans to deepen your knowledge.

Step 1: Understand core concepts
Before jumping into Docker hands-on, grasping some fundamental concepts is important. Here's a breakdown
of the main Docker concepts:

  * Containers: Containers are lightweight, isolated units that package an application along with all
    its dependencies, ensuring it runs consistently across different environments.

  * Images: A Docker image is a read-only template used to create containers. It includes everything
    required to run an application, such as the code, libraries, and system tools. Images are typically
    built from Dockerfiles.

  * Dockerfile: A Dockerfile is a text file containing instructions on how to build a Docker image. It
    outlines steps like installing software, copying files, and configuring the environment needed to
    run the application.

  * Docker Hub: Docker Hub is a public registry where you can store, share, and download Docker
    images. It serves as a central repository for Docker images, enabling easy distribution and reuse
    of pre-configured environments.

  * Volumes: Volumes are a way to persist data generated and used in Docker containers. They allow you
    to manage and store data outside the container's lifecycle, ensuring that important data isn't lost
    when containers are stopped or removed.

  * Networks: Docker networks facilitate communication between containers. Each container can be connected
    to one or more networks, enabling them to interact and share data securely.

Docker architecture overview
Understanding these core concepts is essential before you begin deploying applications with Docker. Mastering
these basics will provide a solid foundation, making the hands-on practice more effective.

The Introduction to Docker course can significantly help solidify your current knowledge.

Step 2: Install Docker
To start using Docker, you'll need to install it on your system. Below are the instructions for different

3. Installing Docker on Linux
Supported Distributions:
  * Ubuntu
  * Debian
  * Fedora
  * CentOS
  * RHEL

Steps for Ubuntu/Debian:
1. Uninstall old versions:
    Before installing Docker Engine, remove conflicting packages using this command:
$> for pkg in docker.io docker-doc docker-compose podman-docker containerd runc; do sudo apt-get remove $pkg; done

2. Set up Docker's apt repository:
    Run the following commands:
$> sudo apt-get update
$> sudo apt-get install ca-certificates curl
$> sudo install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings
$> sudo curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc
$> sudo chmod a+r /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc
$> echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc] \
	https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(. /etc/os-release && echo "$VERSION_CODENAME") stable" | \
	sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
$> sudo apt-get update

3. Install Docker packages:
    Install Docker Engine and other necessary components:
$> sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin

4. Verify installation:
    Run the following command to check if Docker is installed:
$> sudo docker --version

Step 3: Run your first container
Now that Docker is installed, it's time to run your first container. We'll start with the simple
hello-world image, perfect for beginners.

1. Open your terminal (or Command Prompt on Windows) and run the following command:
$> sudo docker run hello-world

This command tells Docker to look for the hello-world image locally. If it doesn't find it, Docker will
pull the image from Docker Hub and then run it.

If Docker is installed correctly, you'll see a message that says, "Hello from Docker!" along with details
about how the Docker process works. This output confirms that Docker successfully pulled the image,
created a new container, and executed the code inside it.

Step 4: Build your first Docker image
In this step, you'll create a custom Docker image for a simple data science project. This image will
include Python and common data science libraries like pandas, NumPy, and scikit-learn.

1. Create a new directory:
        Start by creating a new directory for your project and navigating into it:
$> mkdir my-data-science-app
$> cd my-data-science-app

2. Create a Dockerfile:
Inside this directory, create a file named Dockerfile (without any file extension):

# Use an official Python runtime as a parent image
FROM python:3.8-slim

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the current directory contents into the container at /app
COPY . /app

# Install any needed packages specified in requirements.txt
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Make port 8888 available to the world outside this container
EXPOSE 8888

# Run a Jupyter notebook server when the container launches
CMD ["jupyter", "notebook", "--ip=0.0.0.0", "--port=8888", "--no-browser", "--allow-root"]

The Dockerfile does the following:
    FROM python:3.8-slim: This sets the base image to Python 3.8 in its slim variant, a minimal version
                          of Python, ideal for a lightweight data science environment.

    WORKDIR /app: This sets the working directory inside the container to /app. All subsequent commands
                  will be executed within this directory.

    COPY . /app: This copies all files from your current directory on the host machine and puts them
                 into the /app directory in the container. This typically includes your data science scripts
                 and configuration files.

    RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt: This installs the Python libraries listed in
                                                        requirements.txt. Common libraries for data science
                                                        include pandas, NumPy, and scikit-learn.

    EXPOSE 8888: This makes port 8888 available to the host machine, the default port for Jupyter notebooks.

    CMD ["jupyter", "notebook", "--ip=0.0.0.0", "--port=8888", "--no-browser", "--allow-root"]:
    This command launches a Jupyter notebook server when the container starts, making it accessible from your
    web browser.

3. Create a requirements.txt File:
In the same directory, create a requirements.txt file to list the Python packages your application needs:
pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
matplotlib

This file lists the Python libraries that will be installed inside your Docker container.

4. Build the Docker image:
    With the Dockerfile and requirements.txt ready, build your Docker image using the following command:
$> sudo docker build -t my-data-science-app .

The command above does the following:
    docker build: Initiates the process of building a Docker image.

    -t my-data-science-app: The -t option tags the image as "my-data-science-app."

    .: The dot at the end specifies the build context, which is the current directory. Docker will use
       the files in this directory to build the image.

5. Run the Docker image:
Once the build process is complete, you can run your new Docker image as a container:
$> sudo docker run -p 8888:8888 my-data-science-app

Let's break down the command:
    docker run: Runs a container based on the specified image.

    -p 8888:8888: The -p option maps port 8888 on your local machine to port 8888 inside the container,
                  allowing you to access the Jupyter Notebook server by navigating to localhost:8888 in your
                  web browser.

    my-data-science-app: This specifies the image to run.

Step 5: Use Docker Compose
Docker Compose is an essential tool for managing multi-container applications. In a data science project,
you might need separate containers for different components, such as a Jupyter notebook, a database for
storing data, and a data visualization tool.

Docker Compose allows you to define these services in a single YAML file, making it easy to spin up your
entire data science environment with one command.

1. Create a docker-compose.yml file:
    In your project directory, create a file named docker-compose.yml and write the following lines in
    the file:

version: '3.8'
services:
  jupyter:
        image: jupyter/scipy-notebook:latest
        volumes:
        - ./notebooks:/home/joelwembo/work
        ports:
        - "8888:8888"
        environment:
        - JUPYTER_ENABLE_LAB=yes

  postgres:
        image: postgres:13-alpine
        environment:
        POSTGRES_USER: myuser
        POSTGRES_PASSWORD: mypassword
        POSTGRES_DB: mydatabase
        volumes:
        - postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
        ports:
        - "5432:5432"

  redis:
        image: redis:alpine
        ports:
        - "6379:6379"

volumes:
  postgres_data:


Let's break down what the Docker Compose file does:
    version: '3.8': This specifies the version of the Docker Compose file format. Version 3.8 is a
                    commonly used version that supports many features.

    services:: The services section defines the different containers (services) that make up your
               application.

    jupyter:: This service represents a Jupyter notebook environment essential for interactive data analysis.

    image: jupyter/scipy-notebook:latest: This specifies the Docker image to use for the Jupyter notebook,
                                          which includes popular data science libraries like NumPy, pandas,
                                          and matplotlib.

    volumes:
    - ./notebooks:/home/joelwembo/work: This mounts the notebooks directory on your host machine
                                        to /home/joelwembo/work inside the container, allowing you to persist
                                        and share your notebooks.  Note: This is my personal path and yours
                                        should look different.

    ports:
    - "8888:8888": This maps port 8888 on your host machine to port 8888 in the container, which is the
                   default port for Jupyter notebooks.

    environment:
    - JUPYTER_ENABLE_LAB=yes: This enables JupyterLab, a more powerful interface for working with Jupyter
                              notebooks.

    postgres:: This service runs a PostgreSQL database, which is often used to store and manage large
               datasets in data science projects.

    image: postgres:13-alpine: This specifies the Docker image for PostgreSQL version 13, based on the
                               lightweight Alpine Linux distribution.

    environment:: These environment variables configure the database with a user, password, and database
                  name.

    volumes:
    - postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data: This mounts a Docker volume to persist the database data outside
                                              the container, so your data isn't lost when the container is
                                              stopped.

    ports:
    - "5432:5432": This maps port 5432 on your host machine to port 5432 in the container, the default port
                   for PostgreSQL.

    redis:: This service runs a Redis server, which can be used as a fast in-memory data store or cache.

    image: redis:alpine: This specifies the Redis image using the lightweight Alpine variant.

    ports:
    - "6379:6379": This maps port 6379 on your host machine to port 6379 in the container, the default port
                   for Redis.

    volumes:: This section defines named volumes that can be shared between services or persist data
              across container restarts.

    postgres_data:: This creates a named volume for persisting PostgreSQL data.

To start your multi-container application, simply run the following:
$> sudo docker compose up

This command builds the images (if necessary) and starts the containers defined in your docker-compose.yml
file. It brings up both the web application and the Redis service, allowing them to communicate with
each other as defined.

You have now deployed your first Docker application! Isn't that great? Now, let's elaborate a plan for
