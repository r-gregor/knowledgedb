Solitaire in a Bash script

   I like to write Bash scripts. It stems from my time as a Unix and Linux systems administrator, years
   ago. I used to automated everything. So I got very good at writing shell scripts. Even today when
   managing a personal server, I write Bash scripts to automate various jobs so I don't have to keep
   logging into the server all the time. For example, I have a job that [2]parses an RSS news feed with
   Bash.
   I admit that my Bash scripts aren't always for automation. Some of my scripts are just for fun. Like
   the Bash script to fill out my [3]March Madness basketball brackets. It can be an interesting
   diversion to write a Bash script to do something innovative.
   And lately, I've started writing another such Bash script. Let me tell you about it.
   We all know the classic Klondike Solitaire card game. There have been countless computer
   implementations of Solitaire on every platform. We even had a simple Solitaire game on our old Apple
   IIe computer in the 1980s. If you run Linux, you may be familiar with [4]AisleRiot, which supports
   multiple card solitaire games, including the classic Klondike Solitaire. More recently, Google now
   provides a browser-based version of Klondike Solitaire; just search for the term [5]"solitaire" and
   you'll get an option to "Click to play" the web version.
   I wanted to write my own version of Klondike Solitaire as a Bash script. Sure, I could grab another
   shell script implementation of Solitaire called [6]Shellitaire but I liked the challenge of writing
   my own.
   And I did. Or rather, I mostly did. I have run out of free time to work on it. So I'm sharing it here
   in case others want to build on it. I have implemented most of the game, except for the card
   selection. You might think that's the toughest part, but I don't think so; I'll explain at the end.
   So, how do you write a solitaire card game in a shell script?
   I found it was easiest to leverage the strength of shell scripts: files. I started with all 52 cards
   in a single "deck" file, shuffled it, then "drew" cards from the deck into piles on the tableau.
   Let's start with the basics. Creating 52 cards, comprised of thirteen cards of four different suits,
   is straightforward:
for s in c d h s ; do
  for n in $(seq 1 13) ; do
    echo "$s$n"
  done
done

   You can direct the output to a file, and you have a file containing an ordered representation of all
   52 cards. On a Linux system, you can use GNU shuf(1) to randomize ("shuffle") an input file, which
   can also be a pipe. So to define a shuffled deck of 52 cards, you do this:
deck=/tmp/sol/deck

for s in c d h s ; do
  for n in $(seq 1 13) ; do
    echo "$s$n"
  done
done | shuf > $deck

   Drawing cards from the deck requires a little more work, but not much more. I wrote a simple function
   popn() that takes ("pops") the first n lines of a file and returns those lines, and shortens the file
   at the same time. Usually, this will be one at a time, but we'll need the flexibility later.
   On top of that function, I wrote another simple function drawcard() that draws a single card from the
   deck and assigns it to the end of a "drawn cards" pile. This function also needs a little extra logic
   to deal with an empty deck; if the deck is empty, we return the drawn cards to the deck and start
   over. This is why it's important to pop from the start of the deck and append drawn cards to the end
   of the "drawn cards" pile; you can easily reset the deck using the drawn cards:
function popn() {
  # pop the first n($2) items from a file($1) and print it
  head -$2 $1
  cp $1 /tmp/tempfile
  awk "NR>$2 {print}" /tmp/tempfile > $1
}

function drawcard() {
  if [ $(cat $deck | wc -l) -eq 0 ] ; then
    cp $draw $deck
    >$draw
  fi

  popn $deck 1 >> $draw
}

   In Klondike Solitaire, the play area is a tableau of seven piles of cards, where the first n-1 cards
   are piled "face down" and the last card is placed "face up." So for the first column, there are no
   "face down" cards, and only one "face up" card. On the seventh column, you start with six "face down"
   cards, and only one "face up" card. The player must move cards on these seven piles, eventually
   transferring the cards to four separate "foundation" piles, where each pile is dedicated to a
   separate suit: clubs, diamonds, hearts, and spades.
   Creating the play area requires the use of Bash arrays. I rarely use arrays in Bash, but they are a
   very useful feature. Bash supports both indexed arrays (0, 1, 2, …) and associative arrays (where the
   index is a string value). You define a variable as an indexed array using the declare -a directive,
   and as an associative array with the declare -A directive.
   With this, it's simple enough to define the tableau card piles as separate files, then use the popn()
   function to deal cards from the deck into these files.
declare -a tabdraw
for n in $(seq 1 7) ; do tabdraw[$n]="/tmp/sol/tab.draw.$n" ; done

declare -a pile
for n in $(seq 1 7) ; do tab[$n]="/tmp/sol/tab.$n" ; done

declare -A found
for s in c d h s ; do found[$s]="/tmp/sol/found.$s" ; done

# deal cards from deck into tableau {curly brackets needed on array refs}

for n in $(seq 1 7) ; do popn $deck 1 >> ${tab[$n]} ; done

for n in $(seq 1 7) ; do popn $deck $((n - 1)) >> ${tabdraw[$n]} ; done

   And that's the guts of a Solitaire game in Bash! When assembled, my Bash script looked like this:
#!/bin/bash

# create work directory

tmpdir="/tmp/sol.tmp.$RANDOM"
[ ! -d $tmpdir ] && mkdir $tmpdir

# create variables

deck="$tmpdir/deck"
draw="$tmpdir/draw"
tmpf="$tmpdir/tmpf"

declare -a tabdraw
for n in $(seq 1 7) ; do tabdraw[$n]="$tmpdir/tab.draw.$n" ; done

declare -a pile
for n in $(seq 1 7) ; do tab[$n]="$tmpdir/tab.$n" ; done

declare -A found
for s in c d h s ; do found[$s]="$tmpdir/found.$s" ; done

# create functions

function popn() {
  # pop the first n($2) items from a file($1) and print it
  head -$2 $1
  cp $1 $tmpf
  awk "NR>$2 {print}" $tmpf > $1
}

function drawcard() {
  if [ $(cat $deck | wc -l) -eq 0 ] ; then
    cp $draw $deck
    >$draw
  fi

  popn $deck 1 >> $draw
}

function showcards() {
  # show the cards again - repaint the screen

  clear

  for n in $(seq 1 7) ; do cat ${tabdraw[$n]} | wc -l > $tmpdir/wc.$n ; done

  paste $tmpdir/wc.[1-7]
  paste ${tab[*]}

  echo '___  ___  ___  ___'

  paste ${found[*]}

  echo '___'

  cat $deck | wc -l
  tail -1 $draw
}

# build and shuffle initial deck

for s in c d h s ; do
  echo "${s}0" > ${found[$s]}

  for n in $(seq 1 13) ; do
    echo "$s$n"
  done
done | shuf > $deck

# deal cards from deck into tableau {curly brackets needed on array refs}

for n in $(seq 1 7) ; do popn $deck 1 >> ${tab[$n]} ; done

for n in $(seq 1 7) ; do popn $deck $((n - 1)) >> ${tabdraw[$n]} ; done

# loop until quit ('q')

input='n'
while [ "$input" != "q" ] ; do
  case "$input" in
  'n')
    # draw next card
    drawcard
    ;;
  *)
    # parse into card1,card2
    # is this a valid request?
    # is this a valid move?
    ;;
  esac

  showcards

  echo -n '?> '
  read input
done

# cleanup

rm -rf $tmpdir

   I have left unfinished the logic to move cards around on the tableau. This might seem like the most
   difficult part, but not really. Since every pile on the tableau is a file, it's easy enough to seek a
   requested card in each of the "face up" piles, then extract all lines (cards) from that "face up"
   pile and append them onto another "face up" pile. You'd need a little extra logic in there to move
   Kings to an empty space on the tableau, but that's not very difficult.
   I envisioned splitting the logic into three parts:
   1. Verifying that this is a valid request

     For example, the user is not allowed to move a black card onto a black card. Also, the user can
     only move cards in descending order on the tableau, and ascending order on the foundation. That's
     easy logic.

   2. Confirming that the cards are there to move

     This should be a fairly straightforward process using fgrep(1) to locate the requested cards on
     the tableau or in the foundation.

   3. Moving the cards

     I believe this should be easy, if you remember that cards are only entries in files. You can
     easily write a function that outputs all lines starting with card A, and appends them to the end
     of another file. At the same time, the function can truncate the first file starting at card A.

   When you start the script, you should see output similar to this:
0       1       2       3       4       5       6
s12     c11     s2      h7      s11     h11     d3
___     ___     ___     ___
c0      d0      h0      s0
___
23
c13
?>

   The output is intentionally functional, and uses paste(1) to merge the output from several tableau
   files. What you're seeing:
     * The first line shows the number of cards remaining in each of the tableau "face down" piles.
     * The second line shows the "face up" cards for each pile on the tableau. This sample output
       indicates: 12 (Queen) of Spades, 11 (Jack) of Clubs, 2 of Spades, 7 of Hearts, 11 (Jack) of
       Spades, 11 (Jack) of Hearts, and 3 of Diamonds.
     * The third line shows the empty foundation piles. I initialized these as the "zero" cards so the
       logic to transfer cards to the foundation could remain simple; you only move cards of the same
       suit in ascending order.
     * The fourth line shows the number of cards remaining to be drawn on the deck.
     * The fifth line shows the "face up" card from the deck. In this case, it is the 13 (King) of
       Clubs.
     * The last line shows a prompt (?>) for the user to enter a command.

   This Bash script was a lot of fun to write, but I don't have time to finish it. The script took an
   afternoon to write, and an hour to tweak. Even so, I think this is a solid start to play Solitaire in
   a Bash script.

Parsing an RSS News Feed with a Bash Script

   Wed, 07/13/2016 - 11:11 — [6]Jim Hall

   I am involved in several free software projects, including one or two where I maintain the website.
   For one of those projects, we currently are updating the website. Ours is probably similar to other
   free software projects. We use a hosting service for several key services, including news, but we run
   our website on a web server that we own. In our case, we run most of our project on SourceForge and
   run the website on a third-party service, so the news and website are on different systems.

   Not surprisingly, our project uses an RSS feed to pull news items from SourceForge to display on the
   project website. Previously, our website used a PHP script to cache a copy of the RSS file, then
   parse it every time a visitor arrived at our front page. That worked well, but was somewhat fragile
   if the remote news server was slow or temporarily unreachable.

   As we work on the website update, however, I want to improve how we display news items. I want to
   automate the news service to pull down a copy of the RSS feed, parse it and save the news items to a
   local file that the website can just include. That reduces complexity on the website, and it means
   the front page will load faster every time.

   Initially, I adapted our previous PHP website code into a PHP script that I could run from the
   command line. That did the job, but I thought there had to be a better way. I wondered if I could
   parse the RSS feed from a Bash script instead—and, it turns out that you can! It's easy!

A Brief RSS Primer
   You may know that RSS is just a form of XML, which itself is a simple markup language. XML elements
   are values set off by tags. A tag is any markup that begins with the less-than symbol (<) and ends
   with the greater-than symbol (>). Tags are one of three types:
    1. Start tags, to mark the start of a value (such as <item>).
    2. End tags, to mark the end of a value (</item>).
    3. "Empty element" tags, which might contain values as attributes (<feedburner:info
       uri="linuxjournalcom" />).

   In RSS feeds, most values are set off by start and end tags, like this link to Linux Journal:

<link>http://www.linuxjournal.com/</link>

   RSS feeds have a well defined format. After some header information to describe the news website or
   "channel", the RSS feed displays separate news items inside <item>...</item> elements. Each news item
   contains a title, link, publication date, full description and other fields. A sample RSS file might
   look like this:

<xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?>
<rss xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/" version="2.0">
   <channel>
      <title>RSS title</title>
      <link>http://www.example.com/</link>
      <description>RSS description</description>
      <language>en</language>
      <item>
         <title>News item title</title>
         <link>http://www.example.com/link/to/news/item/</link>
         <guid isPermaLink="true">identifier-5f4b02697d2006f72648ebd0d9c6ce96</guid>
         <description>Full news item text.</description>
         <pubDate>Fri, 01 Jul 2016 17:41:07 +0000</pubDate>
      </item>
   </channel>
</rss>


   Although in most news feeds, the RSS data is transmitted without the indents or newlines. For
   example, the above sample RSS would more likely look like this:

<xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?><rss xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/" version="2.0"><channel>
<title>RSS title</title><link>http://www.example.com/</link><description>RSS
description</description><language>en</language><item><title>News item
title</title><link>http://www.example.com/link/to/news/item/</link><guid
isPermaLink="true">identifier-5f4b02697d2006f72648ebd0d9c6ce96</guid><description>Full
news item text.</description><pubDate>Fri, 01 Jul 2016 17:41:07
+0000</pubDate></item></channel></rss>


   When pulling news items from an RSS feed, I'm concerned only with a few elements:
     * The title of the news item (<title>).
     * The link to the full news item (<link>).
     * The date the news item was published (<pubDate>).
     * The full text of the news item (<description>).

   And conveniently, all of those values are marked by start and end tags. That's the key assumption to
   parsing an RSS feed with a Bash script. For an RSS parser, I just want to grab values surrounded by
   start and end tags.

The "Read" Statement

   You may not think Bash can parse data files, but it can with some clever thinking. Bash, like other
   UNIX shells before it, can read lines one at a time from a file via the built-in read statement.

   By default, the read statement reads a line of data and splits it into fields. Usually, read splits
   fields using space and tab, with newlines ending each lines, but you can change this behavior by
   setting the Internal Field Separator (IFS) value and the end-of-line delimiter.

   To parse an RSS feed using read, set the IFS to a greater-than symbol (>) and the delimiter to a
   less-than symbol (<). Each time Bash reads a line, it reads up to the next < (the start of a tag)
   then splits that data at each > (the end of a tag). This sample code reads the input and splits the
   data into the TAG and VALUE variables:

local IFS='>'
read -d '<' TAG VALUE


   Let's explore how this works. Consider this simple input:
<title>RSS title</title>

   The first time read parses this line, it stops at the first < symbol. Since < is the first character
   of the input, that means Bash finds an empty string. The split TAG and VALUE strings are also empty,
   which may seem odd, but that's okay, because an RSS parser isn't paying attention to empty tags
   anyway.

   The next time Bash reads the input, it gets title>RSS title and stops at the next < symbol. Then read
   splits the line at the > symbol, which leaves TAG with title and VALUE with RSS title.

   The third time read parses the input, it reads the remaining text and stops at the end of the file.
   Bash splits the string /title> into TAG containing /title and an empty VALUE.

A Simple Parser

   With this read magic, it's easy to parse an RSS file with Bash. Let's start with a simple RSS parser
   that displays tags between < > and values between { }, so you can see where tags and values begin and
   end. First, you'll need a Bash function called xmlgetnext to parse the data using read, since you'll
   be doing this again and again in the script:

xmlgetnext () {
   local IFS='>'
   read -d '<' TAG VALUE
}

   Note that you define IFS locally, while leaving TAG and VALUE as global variables. Ordinarily,
   variables and their values in a Bash function are shared between the function and its caller, so you
   need to declare only IFS as local. You want the calling script to see the values of TAG and VALUE.

   Then, you loop using while as you parse the RSS input file and print the resulting TAG and VALUE. The
   Bash script is very brief:

#!/bin/sh
xmlgetnext () {
   local IFS='>'
   read -d '<' TAG VALUE
}

cat $1 | while xmlgetnext ; do
   echo "<$TAG>{$VALUE}"
done

   Now, let's use the sample RSS file from earlier in the article. From that input, the simple parser
   should print this:

<>{}
<xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?>{}
<rss xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/" version="2.0">{}
<channel>{}
<title>{RSS title}
</title>{}
<link>{http://www.example.com/}
</link>{}
<description>{RSS description}
</description>{}
<language>{en}
</language>{}
<item>{}
<title>{News item title}
</title>{}
<link>{http://www.example.com/link/to/news/item/}
</link>{}
<guid isPermaLink="true">{identifier-5f4b02697d2006f72648ebd0d9c6ce96}
</guid>{}
<description>{Full news item text.}
</description>{}
<pubDate>{Fri, 01 Jul 2016 17:41:07 +0000}
</pubDate>{}
</item>{}
</channel>{}

Parsing an RSS News Feed
   Remember that the RSS feed displays separate news items inside <item>...</item> elements. Also, each
   news item contains a title, link, publication date and full description as <title>...</title>,
   <link>...</link>, <pubDate>...</pubDate> and <description>...</description>, respectively. To parse
   this via a Bash script, you look for each <title>, <link>, <pubDate> and <description> tag, then
   write the associated html code when you find the ending </item> tag.

   Most websites display news items using the article's title as the header, such as an <h3> header, and
   the full article text in the article body. If the feed does not already surround the article text
   with <p> or <div> markup, you will need to provide that. You also may prefer to include the article's
   publication date and link back to the original article for more details. With these assumptions and
   the xmlgetnext function, it's easy to parse an RSS news feed in Bash:

#!/bin/sh
xmlgetnext () {
   local IFS='>'
   read -d '<' TAG VALUE
}

cat $1 | while xmlgetnext ; do
   case $TAG in
      'item')
         title=''
         link=''
         pubDate=''
         description=''
         ;;
      'title')
         title="$VALUE"
         ;;
      'link')
         link="$VALUE"
         ;;
      'pubDate')
         pubDate="$VALUE"
         ;;
      'description')
         description="$VALUE"
         ;;
      '/item')
         cat<<EOF
<article>
<h3><a href="$link">$title</a></h3>
<p>$description
<span class="post-date">posted on $pubDate</span></p>
</article>
EOF
         ;;
      esac
done

   The script zeroes out the title, link, pubDate and description variables when the parser reaches the
   first <item> tag and creates the HTML code when the parser reaches the next </item> tag. In between,
   the script stores the title, link, pubDate and description values it finds in the RSS feed's article.
   Running this script against the sample RSS file, you should see this output:
<article>
<h3><a href="http://www.example.com/link/to/news/item/">News item title</a></h3>
<p>Full news item text.
<span class="post-date">posted on Fri, 01 Jul 2016 17:41:07 +0000</span></p>
</article>


   You can make a few improvements based on this script. For example, the publication date isn't very
   nice to read. Let's display this in a more human-friendly format and enclose the date in a
   <time>...</time> HTML element so screen readers can better understand it. For that, you'll need to
   convert the publication date into an ISO-8601 timestamp and create a "display" date in "MM/DD/YY
   HH:MMam" format:

#!/bin/sh
xmlgetnext () {
   local IFS='>'
   read -d '<' TAG VALUE
}

cat $1 | while xmlgetnext ; do
   case $TAG in
      'item')
         title=''
         link=''
         pubDate=''
         description=''
         ;;
      'title')
         title="$VALUE"
         ;;
      'link')
         link="$VALUE"
         ;;
      'pubDate')
         # convert pubDate format for <time datetime="">
         datetime=$( date --date "$VALUE" --iso-8601=minutes )
         pubDate=$( date --date "$VALUE" '+%D %H:%M%P' )
         ;;
      'description')
         description="$VALUE"
         ;;
      '/item')
         cat<<EOF
<article>
<h3><a href="$link">$title</a></h3>
<p>$description
<span class="post-date">posted on <time
datetime="$datetime">$pubDate</time></span></p>
</article>
EOF
         ;;
      esac
done


   This script produces HTML that is both easier for a human to understand and for a screen reader to
   interpret:

<article>
<h3><a href="http://www.example.com/link/to/news/item/">News item title</a></h3>
<p>Full news item text.
<span class="post-date">posted on <time datetime="2016-07-01T12:41-05:00">07/01/16
12:41pm</time></span></p>
</article>


   If the full article text contains HTML tags, RSS will convert the HTML < and > to &lt; and &gt;. An
   RSS parser will need to undo those changes. You can do this with an inline edit via sed, the stream
   editor:

#!/bin/sh
xmlgetnext () {
   local IFS='>'
   read -d '<' TAG VALUE
}

cat $1 | while xmlgetnext ; do
   case $TAG in
      'item')
         title=''
         link=''
         pubDate=''
         description=''
         ;;
      'title')
         title="$VALUE"
         ;;
      'link')
         link="$VALUE"
         ;;
      'pubDate')
         # convert pubDate format for <time datetime="">
         datetime=$( date --date "$VALUE" --iso-8601=minutes )
         pubDate=$( date --date "$VALUE" '+%D %H:%M%P' )
         ;;
      'description')
         # convert '&lt;' and '&gt;' to '<' and '>'
         description=$( echo "$VALUE" | sed -e 's/&lt;/</g' -e 's/&gt;/>/g' )
         ;;
      '/item')
         cat<<EOF
<article>
<h3><a href="$link">$title</a></h3>
<p>$description
<span class="post-date">posted on <time
datetime="$datetime">$pubDate</time></span></p>
</article>
EOF
         ;;
      esac
done


   And with that, I have everything I need to update my project's website so it can be more efficient:

wget --quiet -O $rsslocalfile $rssfeedurl
./parse.sh $rsslocalfile > $newslocalfile.html


   Now I can automate this hourly job to retrieve a copy of the RSS feed, parse it, and save the news
   items to a local file that the website can incorporate. That reduces complexity on the website, with
   only a little extra work by parsing the RSS news feed with a Bash script.

March Madness in a shell script
   I don't really follow the sportsball. But I do like to engage with others at my office who do. So
   every Spring, I feel somewhat left out as everyone at my office gets wrapped up in college basketball
   fever. I watch them fill out their NCAA March Madness brackets, and I always think about
   participating, but I know nothing about the sport other than you have to dunk the orange ball in the
   other team's hoopy net.
   I'd like to take part in the fun, maybe put my five dollars into the office pool, but I just don't
   know enough about the teams to make an informed decision on my own March Madness bracket. So a few
   years ago, I found another way: I wrote a little program to do it for me.
   Computer models that predict the outcome of matches isn't a new topic. You can find lots of models,
   including the Pythagorean Expectation Model or other algorithms that build on previous team
   performance to predict future game outcomes. But that requires some research into sports statistics
   and following each team throughout the season. That's too much work for me. I used a different method
   that should be familiar to many of my fellow nerds: the "Dungeons and Dragons Model."
   That's right! You can apply a simple D16 method to build a March Madness basketball bracket. How
   scientific is this? Probably not very, but it's enough to give me a stake to follow March Madness
   basketball, but not enough that I feel particularly saddened if my bracket doesn't perform well.
   That's good enough for me.
   Let me show you how to build a Bash shell script to build your own NCAA March Madness bracket. I'll
   use the following three simple assumptions:
    1. The NCAA March Madness basketball brackets are seeded with the NCAA's ranking of 64 college
       basketball teams, divided into four regions, and ranked #1 through #16.
    2. The NCAA March Madness basketball brackets are always initialized with the same contests: #1 vs
       #16, #8 vs #9, #5 vs #12, and so on.
    3. A #1 ranked team should perform better than a #16 team, but a #8 team should perform about the
       same as a #9 team.

   Using these assumptions, let's examine the D16 method. In a tabletop role-playing game, you might
   throw a 1D16 to determine the outcome of an encounter. You would compare the value of the 1D16 to a
   player's statistic, such as Dexterity or Strength. This kind of throw assumes a "probability" or
   "likelihood" of an outcome based on the relative strength of the player. A player with a high
   Dexterity is more likely to dodge a blow than a player with a lower Dexterity. Usually, I see the DM
   compare the 1D16 to the player's statistic to determine the outcome.
   Similarly, we can compare the outcome of a 1D16 to a team's NCAA ranking to determine the outcome of
   a team's performance. A #1 team should be a strong team, so let's assume the #1 team has fifteen out
   of sixteen "chances" to win, and one out of sixteen "chance" to lose. Without any other inputs, the
   #1 team would win if the 1D16 value is two or greater, and the #1 team would lose if the 1D16 value
   is one.
   Using this assumption, we can throw a 1D16 to determine if team "A" wins, and a 1D16 to determine if
   team "B" loses, or vice versa. If the two throws agree, we know the outcome of the game.
   In Bash, we generate a random number every time you reference the $RANDOM environment variable. The
   variable returns a value between 0 and 32,767, but we want a number between one and sixteen. We can
   reduce the random number's range to sixteen values by using the modulo operator. Using modulo 16
   returns a value between zero and fifteen. Adjusting that to a number between one and sixteen is
   simple addition:
d16=$(( ( $RANDOM % 16 ) + 1 ))

   Here's a Bash function that assumes two inputs are the NCAA rankings of two teams, team "A" and team
   "B." Using the D16 method, the function predicts the winner of a game and returns the winning team in
   the function's exit value.
function guesswinner {
 rankA=$1
 rankB=$2

 d16A=$(( ( $RANDOM % 16 ) + 1 ))
 d16B=$(( ( $RANDOM % 16 ) + 1 ))

 if [ $d16A -gt $rankA -a $d16B -le $rankB ] ; then
         # team A wins and team B loses
         return $rankA
 elif [ $d16A -le $rankA -a $d16B -gt $rankB ] ; then
         # team A loses and team B wins
         return $rankB
 else
         # no winner
         return 0
 fi
}

   Of course, the D16 method assumes the two outcomes agree. While this method works most of the time,
   it's possible that neither results in a winner. A simple workaround is to try again. I find the
   outcomes agree within one or a few throws, but for an evenly-matched game, such as a #1 team against
   a #2 team, you might have to give up after too many attempts.
   With that assumption, let's write a Bash function to repeatedly call guesswinner until the two
   outcomes agree. The function prints the match-up, prints the winner, and returns the winning team via
   the exit value.
function winner {
 teamA=$1
 teamB=$2

 echo -n "$teamA vs $teamB : "

 count=0

 # iterate and return winner, if found

 while [ $count -lt 10 ] ; do
         guesswinner $teamA $teamB
         win=$?

         if [ $win -gt 0 ] ; then
                 # winner found
                 echo $win
                 return $win
         fi

         count=$(( $count + 1 ))
 done

 # no winner found, return a default winner

 echo "=$teamA"
 return $teamA
}

   The = in the last echo statement helps you see if the function was unable to determine a winner after
   ten attempts.
   With these two functions, it's very simple to run through all the first-round games to determine
   winners, then iterate through those winners to build the rest of the basketball bracket. A few echo
   statements help us to follow each round in the bracket. The function returns the winner of the
   bracket via the return value.
function playbracket {
 echo -e '\nround 1\n'

 winner 1 16
 round1A=$?

 winner 8 9
 round1B=$?

 winner 5 12
 round1C=$?

 winner 4 13
 round1D=$?

 winner 6 11
 round1E=$?

 winner 3 14
 round1F=$?

 winner 7 10
 round1G=$?

 winner 2 15
 round1H=$?

 echo -e '\nround 2\n'

 winner $round1A $round1B
 round2A=$?

 winner $round1C $round1D
 round2B=$?

 winner $round1E $round1F
 round2C=$?

 winner $round1G $round1H
 round2D=$?

 echo -e '\nround 3\n'

 winner $round2A $round2B
 round3A=$?

 winner $round2C $round2D
 round3B=$?

 echo -e '\nround 4\n'

 winner $round3A $round3B

 return $?
}

   Finally, we need only call the playbracket function for each of the four regions. We are left with
   the "Final Four" with the winners of each bracket, but I'll leave the final determination of those
   contests for you to resolve on your own.
#!/bin/bash

function guesswinner {
 …
}
function winner {
 …
}
function playbracket {
 …
}

echo -e '\n___ MIDWEST ___'

playbracket

echo -e '\n___ EAST ___'

playbracket

echo -e '\n___ WEST ___'

playbracket

echo -e '\n___ SOUTH ___'

playbracket

   Every time you run the script, you will generate a fresh NCAA March Madness basketball bracket. It's
   entirely random, based on a D16 prediction similar to Dungeons and Dragons, so each iteration of the
   bracket will be different. In my experience, the D16 prediction works pretty well for the first few
   rounds, but often predicts the #1 team will make it to the fourth round. It's not a very scientific
   method, but I'll share that my computer-generated brackets usually fare well compared to others in my
   office.
   The point of using a script to build your NCAA March Madness basketball bracket isn't to take away
   the fun of the game. On the contrary, since I don't have much familiarity with basketball, building
   my bracket programmatically allows me to participate in the office basketball pool. It's entertaining
   without requiring much familiarity with sports statistics. My script gives me a stake to follow the
   games, but without the emotional investment if my bracket doesn't perform well. And that's good
   enough for me!
   Curious to see my brackets? The output isn't in "bracket" format, but you can see my bracket below,
   as predicted by my script (at least, as of today):

   So for my Final Four, I'm left with Midwest #1, East #5, West #4, and South #1. I wonder how I'll do
   in my office pool?
