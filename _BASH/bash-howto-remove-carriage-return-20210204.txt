How to remove carriage return in Linux or Unix
February 3, 2021 

   How do I remove all the carriage returns \r (^M) from a file in Unix using the command-line options?
   A carriage return is nothing but a control character used to reset a device's position to the
   beginning of a text line. In other words, whenever you hit the [Enter] key, you generate carriage
   return. It is a newline concept. Please note that in ASCII and Unicode, the carriage return is
   defined as 13. So you may see it as control+M (^M). In the C and especially on Linux/macOS or
   Unix-like system, we will see it as \r. In DOS/Windows text files, a line break is a combination of
   two characters: a Carriage Return (CR) followed by a Line Feed (LF). In Unix/Linux/macOS text files,
   a line break is a single character: the Line Feed (LF). This page explains how to remove carriage
   return and update file easily.

Removing carriage return in Linux or Unix
   The procedure to delete carriage return is as follows:
    1. Open the terminal app and then type any one of the following command.
    2. Use the sed: sed 's/\r$//' file.txt > out.txt
    3. Another option is tr: tr -d '\r' input.txt > out.txt
    4. MS-Windows (DOS)/Mac to Unix/Linux and vice versa text file format converter: dos2unix infile
       outfile
    5. Verify that carriage return removed or converted on Linux/Unix:
       od -c output
       OR
       cat -v filename

   Let us see all commands and examples in details.

Viewing carriage return under Linux or Unix
   The syntax is as follows:
$> cat -v input.txt
$> od -c /path/to/file.php

   The cat command prints nonprinting chracters such as ^ and M- notation, except for LFD and TAB.
   To see LFD and TAB pass the -T:
$> cat -T filename

   We use the od command to dump files in octal and other formats on screen. Pass the -c to see
   printable characters or backslash escapes on screen:
$> od -c input
$> cat file | od -c

   Modern text editors such as vim can show carriage return too:
$> vim filename
   How to view carriage return on Linux Unix macOS using cat and od

Deleting carriage return using the sed on Linux/Unix/macOS

   The syntax is:
$> sed 's/\r$//' file.txt > out.txt
$> sed "s/$(printf '\r')\$//" file.php > out.file.php && mv out.file.php file.php

   Sed command has an option to do an in-place file update for both GNU/sed and BSD/sed on macOS. Hence,
   the syntax is:
$> sed -i sed 's/\r$//' input
$> cat -v input

# macos/bsd need file ext #
$> sed -i'.BAKUP' input.file
$> cat -v input.file

DOS/Mac to Unix and vice versa text file format converter
   First install dos2unix text file format converter using the apt command/apt/get command on your
   Ubuntu/Debian box:
$> sudo apt install dos2unix

   RHEL/CentOS/Fedora Linux users try:
$> sudo yum install dos2unix # <-- RHEL/CentOS 7.x
$> sudo dnf install dos2unix # <-- Fedora latest/RHEL/CentOS 8.x

   Now use it as follows:
$> dos2unix input output
$> cat -v output
$> od -c output

Using the tr command under Unix or Linux
   We can convert line breaks in a text file from Unix format (Line feed) to DOS format (carriage return
   + Line feed) and vice versa:
$> cat input | tr -d '\r' > output
$> tr -d '\r' < input > output
$> cat -v output
$> od -c output

A note about perl
   Perl is yet another method to remove all the carriage returns \r from a file in Unix or Linux
   systems. The syntax is:
$> perl -i -p -e 's/\r//g' my_file
$> cat -v my_file
$> od -v my_file

col command
   The col command filters out reverse (and half reverse) line feeds so that the output is in the
   correct order with only forward and half-forward line feeds and replaces white-space characters with
   tabs where possible. We can pass the -b and tell the col not output any backspaces, printing only the
   last character written to each column position as follows:
$> col -b < input_file > output_file
$> cat -v output_file
$> od -c output_file

How to delete and remove carriage return in Linux or Unix
   Deleting carriage return in Linux or Unix using the CLI options

Converting files in bulk
   In the current directory try sed as follows with help of bash for loop:
for f in *.php
	do
		sed -i'-backup.php' 's/\r$//' "$f"
done

   In this final example, search for all PHP files in /app/ directory, including sub-folders, and run
   the sed command on it as follows:
$> find /app/ -type f -iname "*.php" -print0 | xargs -I {} -0 sed -i'-backup.php' 's/\r$//' "{}"

Conclusion
   You learned how to remove or delete carriage return (\r) under Linux and Unix-like system using
   various commands.
