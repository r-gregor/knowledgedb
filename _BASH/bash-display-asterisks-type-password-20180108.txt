How To Display Asterisks When You Type Password In terminal
January 5, 2018

   When you type passwords in a web browser login or any GUI login, the passwords will be masked as
   asterisks like ******** or bullets like •••••••••••••. This is the built-in security mechanism to
   prevent the users near you to view your password. But when you type the password in Terminal to
   perform any administrative task with sudo or su, you won’t even the see the asterisks or bullets as
   you type the password. There won’t be any visual indication of entering passwords, there won’t be any
   cursor movement, nothing at all. You will not know whether you entered all characters or not. All you
   will see just a blank screen!

   Look at the following screenshot.

   As you see in the above image, I’ve already entered the password, but there was no indication (either
   asterisks or bullets). Now, I am not sure whether I entered all characters in my password or not.
   This security mechanism also prevents the person near you to guess the password length. Of course,
   this behavior can be changed. This is what this guide all about. It is not that difficult. Read on!

Display Asterisks When You Type Password In terminal
   To display asterisks as you type password in Terminal, we need to make a small modification in
   “/etc/sudoers” file. Before making any changes, it is better to backup this file. To do so, just run:
sudo cp /etc/sudoers{,.bak}

   The above command will backup /etc/sudoers file to a new file named /etc/sudoers.bak. You can restore
   it, just in case something went wrong after editing the file.

   Next, edit “/etc/sudoers” file using command:
sudo visudo

   Find the following line:
Defaults env_reset

   Add an extra word “,pwfeedback” to the end of that line as shown below.
Defaults env_reset,pwfeedback

   Then, press “CTRL+x” and “y” to save and close the file. Restart your Terminal to take effect the
   changes.

   Now, you will see asterisks when you enter password in Terminal.

   If you’re not comfortable to see a blank screen when you type passwords in Terminal, the small tweak
   will help. Please be aware that the other users can predict the password length if they see the
   password when you type it. If you don’t mind it, go ahead make the changes as described above to make
   your password visible (masked as asterisks, of course!).
