How to merge all PDF files into one PDF in Linux
October 24, 2023

   I recently had to submit multiple PDF files for government work, but the web form only allowed for
   the uploading of a single file. This meant that I had to merge the PDF files into one on Linux. To do
   this, I used a command-line tool called pdfunite, which is a Portable Document Format (PDF) page
   merger. Let us see how to install and use the pdfunite in Linux.

Step 1 - Installing the pdfunite
   You must install Poppler a PDF rendering library based on Xpdf PDF viewer. The syntax for a Debian or
   Ubuntu Linux is as follows using the [17]apt command or [18]apt-get command:
$> sudo apt update
$> sudo apt upgrade
$> sudo apt install poppler-utils

Arch Linux install pdfunite
   Use the pacman command as follows:
$> sudo pacman -S poppler

Fedora Linux install pdfunite
   Try the dnf command as follows to install the same:
$> sudo dnf install poppler-utils

Step 2 - Merging PDF files on Linux
   To merge multiple PDF files into one single file on Linux, try the following syntax:
$> pdfunite input1.pdf input2.pdf OUTPUT.pdf

   The pdfunite command will merge input1.pdf and input2.pdf PDF (Portable Document Format) files in
   order of occurrence on the command line to one PDF result file called OUTPUT.pdf. That is all. You
   can verify it using the ls command and open the OUTPUT.pdf file:
$> ls -l OUTPUT.pdf
$> xdg-open OUTPUT.pdf

Step 3 - Reducing merged/combined PDF file size
   I discovered that only PDF files up to 10MB can be uploaded, so I used a [19]Linux shell script to
   reduce the file size:
$> shrinkpdf.sh OUTPUT.pdf optimized-OUTPUT.pdf

Summing up
   I found that pdfunite is a helpful Linux CLI to merge PDFs into one file. Give it a try. It is a
   convenient tool for CLI buffs.
