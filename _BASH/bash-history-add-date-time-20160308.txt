[13]How to Add Date And Time To Your Bash History file

   This is very useful tip if there are multiple people maintaining or using debian desktop,server or
   even if you are the maintainer, but can't remember exactly when you did or changed something.
   If you want to add this settings to globally use /etc/bash.bashrc

   First you need to Edit your $HOME/.bashrc file
     #vi $HOME/.bashrc

   Add the following line
     export HISTTIMEFORMAT="%h/%d -- %H:%M:%S "

   Save and exit the file.

   From next login instead of:
   574  tail -f /var/log/maillog
   575  mailq | tail -15
   576  tail -f /var/log/maillog
   577  less /var/log/maillog

   you get:
   1002  May/09 -- 11:46:16 grep log /var/log/maillog
   1003  Apr/09 -- 14:17:40 passwd test
   1004  Apr/09 -- 14:50:28 history 15

   Some more bash history tips
   The most efficent way to search your history is to hit Ctrl R and type the start of the command. It
   will autocomplete as soon as there‚Äôs a match to a history entry, then you just hit enter

   If you don't want to save duplicate commands use the following option in your bashrc file
   ($HOME/.bashrc)
     HISTCONTROL=ignoreboth

   If you want to set the size of the history file use the following option in your bashrc file
   ($HOME/.bashrc)
     HISTSIZE=500

       In short:
       export HISTTIMEFORMAT=‚Äô%F %T ‚Äò
       export HISTCONTROL=ignoredups
       export HISTCONTROL=ignoreboth
       export HISTSIZE=5000

       # My .bashrc HISTORY üòâ
       export HISTTIMEFORMAT=‚Äô%F %T ‚Äò # time entry for .bash_history
       export HISTCONTROL=ignoredups # eliminate continuous occurrences duplicates
       export HISTSIZE=100000 # big big histfile
       shopt -s histappend # append to history, don‚Äôt overwrite it
       # Save and reload the history after each command finishes
       export PROMPT_COMMAND=‚Äùhistory -a; history -r; $PROMPT_COMMAND‚Äù

       I had to replace the double quotes with single quotes to get this working

       I like those enhancements, guys! :-)
       Only, it gives me this ‚Äúwise reminder‚Äù after every ENTER hit in the BASH prompt:
       bash: history: cannot use more than one of -anrw
       ‚Ä¶although, I must admit it, I‚Äôm not in ‚ÄúLenny‚Äù, I‚Äôm in OpenSuSE 11.1. But I guess BASH is
       distro-independent, eh? GPL software and all that‚Ä¶
