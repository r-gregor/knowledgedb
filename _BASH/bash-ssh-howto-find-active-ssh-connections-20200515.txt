How to Find Active SSH Connections on Linux

   If you are Linux system administrator and responsible for managing servers then you may often need to
   know how many ssh connections are active on your server and where the connections come from. There
   are several commands and tools available in Linux to find the active SSH connections on your server.

   In this tutorial, we will show how to find active SSH connections with different methods in Linux.

Prerequisites
     * A server running Linux operating system.
     * You have root access on that server.

Find Active SSH Connection with who command
   who is the Linux command-line utility used to displays a list of users who are currently logged into
   the server.

   Open your terminal and run the who command to find the active connections on your server:
who

   You should get the following output:
root     pts/0        2020-05-01 02:37 (27.61.161.61)
root     pts/1        2020-05-01 02:39 (45.58.38.21)

   As you can see there are two active SSH connections from the IP 27.61.161.61 and 45.58.38.21.

Find Active SSH Connection with w command
   w is another command-line utility that displays the information about currently login user on your
   server. This command provides more information than who command like active sessions and running
   process on those sessions.

   You can run the w command as shown below:
w

   You should get the following output:
 02:40:07 up 1 day, 18:35,  2 users,  load average: 0.02, 0.02, 0.00
USER     TTY      FROM             [24][email protected]   IDLE   JCPU   PCPU WHAT
root     pts/0    27.61.161.61     02:37    1.00s  0.04s  0.01s ssh [25][email protected]
root     pts/1    45.58.38.21      02:39    1.00s  0.02s  0.00s w

   As you can see this command also displays the idle time details, source IP, login time, load average
   and processes.

Find Active SSH Connection with ps command
   ps command also gives you the information about active SSH sessions in your server. It gives you some
   additional information like PID of the active SSH connections.

   You can run the ps command as shown below
ps auxwww | grep sshd: | grep -v grep

   You should see the following output:
root         609  0.0  0.1  12160  7268 ?        Ss   Apr29   0:01 sshd: /usr/sbin/sshd -D [listener] 0 of 10-
100 startups
root       35532  0.0  0.2  13864  8796 ?        Ss   02:37   0:00 sshd: [26][email protected]/0
root       35669  0.0  0.2  13860  8916 ?        Ss   02:38   0:00 sshd: [27][email protected]/1

Find Active SSH Connection with netstat command
   Netstat is a command-line tool that can be used to show active or Established SSH connections from
   the remote hosts to your server.

   You can run the netstat command as shown below:
netstat -tnpa | grep 'ESTABLISHED.*sshd'

   You should see the following output:
tcp        0     88 45.58.38.21:22          27.61.161.61:8363       ESTABLISHED 35532/sshd: [28][email protected]
tcp        0      0 45.58.38.21:22          45.58.38.21:51166       ESTABLISHED 35669/sshd: [29][email protected]

Find Active SSH Connection with last command
   The last command is used to displays the list of all users that are logged in and log out since the
   file /var/log/wtmp created. With last command you can also find the active SSH connection information
   between client and server.

   Run the following command to find the active SSH connections in your server.
last -a | grep -i still

   You should see the following output:
root     pts/1        Fri May  1 02:39   still logged in    45.58.38.21
root     pts/0        Fri May  1 02:37   still logged in    27.61.161.61
reboot   system boot  Wed Apr 29 08:04   still running      5.4.0-26-generic

Find Active SSH Connection with ss command
   ss is very similar to netstat and used to display more information than other tools. You can use ssh
   command with grep to list the active SSH connection in your server.Advertisements

   Run the ss command with grep as shown below:
ss | grep -i ssh

   You should see the following output:
tcp   ESTAB  0      0                      45.58.38.21:51166        45.58.38.21:ssh

tcp   ESTAB  0      56                     45.58.38.21:ssh         27.61.161.61:8363

tcp   ESTAB  0      0                      45.58.38.21:ssh          45.58.38.21:51166


   As you can see, there are two active connections from the client IP 45.58.38.21 and 27.61.161.61.

Conclusion
   In the above guide, we learned how to find active SSH connections with different methods. You can now
   easily monitor who are logged in to your server.
