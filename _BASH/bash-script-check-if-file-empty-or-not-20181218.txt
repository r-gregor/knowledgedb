Linux / UNIX: Check If File Is Empty Or Not Using Shell Script
December 12, 2018

   How do I check if a file is empty or not using bash or ksh shell script under a UNIX / Linux / macOS
   / OS X / BSD family of operating systems? How do I check if a file is empty in Bash?
   You can use the find command and other options as follows. The -s option to the test builtin check to
   see if FILE exists and has a size greater than zero. It returns true and false values to indicate
   that file is empty or has some data. This page shows how to check if a file is empty in Bash shell
   running on a Linux or Unix-like operating systems.

Check If File Is Empty Or Not Using Shell Script

   The syntax is as follows:
touch /tmp/file1
ls -l /tmp/file1
find /tmp -empty -name file1

   touch /tmp/file1 ls -l /tmp/file1 find /tmp -empty -name file1

   Sample outputs:
/tmp/file1

   Now create another file with some data in it:
echo "data" > /tmp/file2
ls -l /tmp/file2
find /tmp -empty -name file2

   echo "data" > /tmp/file2 ls -l /tmp/file2 find /tmp -empty -name file2

   You should not see any output from the find command.

Bash Script – Check If File is Empty or Not With the -s Option

   However, one can pass the -s option as follows in script or shell prompt:
touch /tmp/f1
echo "data" >/tmp/f2
ls -l /tmp/f{1,2}
[ -s /tmp/f1 ]
echo $?

   touch /tmp/f1 echo "data" >/tmp/f2 ls -l /tmp/f{1,2} [ -s /tmp/f1 ] echo $?

   Sample outputs:
1

   The non zero output indicate that file is empty.
[ -s /tmp/f2 ]
echo $?

   [ -s /tmp/f2 ] echo $?

   Sample outputs:
0

   Bash Shell Check If File Is Empty Or Not on a Linux/Unix Bash Script/Command – Check If File is Empty
   or Not
   The zero output indicate that file is not empty. So you can write a shell script as follows.

Shell Script To Check If File Is Empty OR Not

#!/bin/bash
_file="$1"
[ $# -eq 0 ] && { echo "Usage: $0 filename"; exit 1; }
[ ! -f "$_file" ] && { echo "Error: $0 file not found."; exit 2; }

if [ -s "$_file" ]
then
        echo "$_file has some data."
        # do something as file has data
else
        echo "$_file is empty."
        # do something as file is empty
fi

   Run it as follows:
   chmod +x script.sh
   ./script.sh /etc/resolv.conf
   Sample outputs:
/etc/resolv.conf has some data.

   Run it on an empty file:
   touch /tmp/test.txt
   ./script.sh /tmp/test.txt
   Sample outputs:
test.txt is empty.

Conclusion
   This page showed how to check if file is empty on a Linux or Unix-like operating systems using
   various commands. See [20]test command for more info.

Test command

test command syntax

test condition

   OR
test condition && true-command

   OR
test condition || false-command

   OR
test condition && true-command || false-command

   Type the following command at a shell prompt (is 5 greater than 2? ):
test 5 -gt 2 && echo "Yes"
test 1 -lt 2 && echo "Yes"

   Sample Output:
Yes
Yes

   You need to use the test command while making decisions. Try the following examples and note down its
   output:
test 5 -eq 5 && echo Yes || echo No
test 5 -eq 15 && echo Yes || echo No
test 5 -ne 10 && echo Yes || echo No
test -f /etc/resolv.conf && echo "File /etc/resolv.conf found." || echo "File /etc/resolv.conf not found."
test -f /etc/resolv1.conf && echo "File /etc/resolv1.conf found." || echo "File /etc/resolv1.conf not found."
