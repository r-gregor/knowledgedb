How to Split a String by Delimiter in Bash Script?

Bash Split String with Examples!!

   plit a String by Delimiter in Bash: In programming, we need to split a string for several purposes.
   Most of the programming languages have an in-built function called 'split' to separate any string
   data into various parts. But, there is no built-in function for splitting the string in the bash
   script. If you want to split a string and extract its individual words, there comes the usage of
   delimiter. The delimiter could be a single character or a string with multiple characters. In this
   article, we will make you understand how to Split a String by Delimiter in Bash Scripting with
   practical examples.

Split String by Space:
   By default, the string value is divided by white space. The shell variable IFS (Internal Field
   Separator) is used in bash for splitting a string into words. This variable is utilized to assign the
   particular delimiter for splitting the string.

   Add the following code in your Text Editor and then save it as split1.sh script.
   Split String by Space

   #Define the string value
   str="Welcome to Linux Tutorial"

   # Set space as the delimiter
   IFS=' '

   read -ra str_array <<< "$str"

   #Print the split string
   for i in "${str_array[@]}"
   do
   echo $i
   done
     * str - String value is declared.
     * IFS - It is a shell variable used to assign the character that will be used for splitting the
       string value.
     * The read command reads the raw input. The option '-r' reads the backslashes()\ literally instead
       of treating them as an escape character. The option '-a' stores the divided words into an array
       variable.
     * $str - String value is assigned.
     * 'for' loop is used to read each element in the array, $str_array.

Split String by Single Character:
   In order to split a string in bash by a single/multiple characters, we have to set the specific
   symbol or character to IFS and read the string to a variable with the options '-ra' as shown below.

Example 1:
   Add the following code in your Text Editor and then save it as splitex1.sh script.
   Split String by Symbol - Example 1

   #Define the string value
   STR="Ubuntu;Fedora;Mint;Arch"

   # Semicolon is set as the delimiter
   IFS=';'

   read -ra ARRAY <<< "$STR"

   #Print the split string
   for i in "${ARRAY[@]}"
   do
   echo $i
   done

   Run the script:
$ bash splitex1.sh

Output:

   The following output will be displayed after executing the Script.

   Ubuntu
   Fedora
   Mint
   Arch

Example 2:
   Add the following code in your Text Editor and then save it as splitex2.sh script.
   Split String by Symbol - Example 2

   #Define the string value
   STR="Split-a-string-in-Bash-Script"

   # Hyphen is set as the delimiter
   IFS='-'

   read -ra ARRAY <<< "$STR"

   #Print the split string
   for i in "${ARRAY[@]}"
   do
   echo $i
   done

   Run the script:
$ bash splitex2.sh

Output:

   The following output will be displayed after executing the Script.

Split String by Mulicharacter:
   Add the following code in your Text Editor and then save it as split2.sh script.
   Split String by Multicharacter

   #Define the string value
   str="LearnXYZBashXYZScripting"

   #Set multi-character delimiter
   delimiter="XYZ"

   #Concatenate the delimiter with the main string
   string=$str$delimiter

   #Split the text based on the delimiter
   myarray=()
   while [[ $string ]]; do
   myarray+=( "${string%%"$delimiter"*}" )
   string=${string#*"$delimiter"}
   done
