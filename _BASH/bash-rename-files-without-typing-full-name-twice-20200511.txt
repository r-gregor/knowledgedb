[Bash Tips] Rename Files Without Typing Full Name Twice In Linux
April 27, 2020

   This brief guide explains how to rename files without typing full name twice in Linux operating
   systems.  As we all already know, we use mv command to rename files in Linux. To rename a file, the
   command would be:
$ mv <old_file_name> <new_file_name>

   Let me show you an example.
$ touch ostechnix1.txt
$ mv ostechnix1.txt ostechnix2.txt

   This is how we rename files using mv command in Linux. The above command will rename the file named
   "ostechnix1.txt" to "ostechnix2.txt". As you see, we type the file names two times in the above
   command. However, it is not necessary. We can easily rename files in Linux using mv command without
   having to type the file names two times, with the help of a simple BASH function.

How To Rename Files Without Typing Full Name Twice In Linux
   Edit your ~/.bashrc file with your favorite editor:
$ nano ~/.bashrc

   Add the following lines at the end:
# Bash Function To Rename Files Without Typing Full Name Twice
function mv() {
    if [ "$#" -ne 1 ] || [ ! -e "$1" ]; then
        command mv "[55][email protected]"
        return
    fi

    read -ei "$1" newfilename
    command mv -v -- "$1" "$newfilename"
}

   Here, the bash function name is mv. You can choose any other different name of your liking. Save and
   close the file. And then run the following command to take effect the changes:
$ source ~/.bashrc

   From now on, you can only specify the original file name and rename the file as shown below.
$ mv ostechnix1.txt

   This will display the file name in the Terminal. Edit the file name and hit ENTER key to rename it.
   Have a look at the following visual demo.

       -- demo gif --
       
   As you see in the above output, I have renamed the file ostechnix1.txt to ostechnix2.doc. Quite
   handy, right?

   Use to arrow keys to move thorough the letters or hit the backspace key to remove all letters and
   type a new name for the file. Not just file name, you can rename the file extension as well. This is
   literally like hitting the F2 key and rename the file in GUI.

Other ways To Rename Files Without Typing Full Name Twice
   There are also a few other ways to rename a file without having to type full name two times.

Method 1 - using mv command
   Apart from the BASH function method, here is another wimple way rename files with mv command. We
   don't even need a BASH function. Use the following one-liner command to quickly rename the file:
$ mv ostechnix{1,2}.txt

   The above command would copy the file named ostechnix1.txt to ostechnix2.txt.

   Here is another example. The following command will rename "IMG_20140210_150415974.jpg to
   "IMG_20140210_ostechnix.jpg".
$ mv IMG_20140210_{150415974,ostechnix}.jpg

   If you don't want to rename, but want to have two copies of the same file, use cp command like below:
$ cp ostechnix{1,2}.txt

   The above command will copy the contents of ostechnix1.txt to ostechnix2.txt. You should have now two
   files with same contents.

Method 2 - Using readline keybindings (CTRL+w,  CTRL+y and CTRL+y)
   We can use readline keybindings to quickly rename a file. These keybindings comes with mainstream
   shells by default. The CTRL+w command will cut the last word from a command and the CTRL+y key will
   paste that word in Terminal.
    -- demo gif --
    
   As you see in the above output,
     * First, I type "mv ostechnix1.txt".
     * Secondly, I press CTRL+w to cut the last word i.e. ostechnix1.txt.
     * Thirdly, I press CTRL+y to paste the last word.
     * Finally, I press CTRL+y once again to paste the same word and then rename it.

Method 3 - Using "imv" from renameutils
   The renameutils is a set of programs that is designed to batch renaming files and directories faster
   and easier. Renameutils consists of an utility called "imv" among others. It allows you to
   interactively rename the file name.

   To rename a file, do:
$ imv ostechnix1.txt

   This will display the above filename in the Terminal. Edit the filename as you like and hit ENTER to
   rename it. To learn about other renaming methods, refer the following guide.
