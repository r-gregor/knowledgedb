[42]Remove lines with less than 4 characters and more than 3 numbers in bash

   up vote 3 down vote [43]favorite

   So for example, I have this text file:
use
user_99
12345

   +10k lines...

   And I want to remove those that have less than 4 characters from the command line, I've already
   searched in google but no results came.

   Any ideas? : )

   I'd also like to remove lines with more than 3 numbers in the beginning.

   Do you want to remove lines that have at least 4 numbers (more than 3) and less than 4 characters or
   lines that have less than 4 letters (irrespective of the number of digits) or lines that have less
   than 4 characters and more than 4 numbers? Please show us an example input and your desired output.

   sed or awk are good choices:
sed -rn '/^.{0,3}$/n; /^[0-9]{3,}/n; p' file

awk --re-interval 'length > 3 && !/^[0-9]{3,}/' file

   You can make a GNU sed regex for at least 4 characters as .{4,} - then to delete all lines except
   those with at least 4 characters:
sed -r '/.{4,}/!d' file

   Similarly, a line starting with more than 3 consecutive digits would be ^[0-9]{4,} so to delete all
   those
sed -r '/^[0-9]{4,}/d' file

   You can combine them either using -e or ;
sed -r -e '/.{4,}/!d' -e '/^[0-9]{4,}/d' file

   or
sed -r '/.{4,}/!d ; /^[0-9]{4,}/d' file

   Note that . matches space characters as well as non-space characters - if that is not what you want
   then you can change it by replacing . with a character range or POSIX class such as [[:alnum:]].
