How to Use the read Command in Linux with Examples
July 20, 2024

   The read command in Linux is a built-in shell command used to read a line of input from the standard
   input (such as the keyboard) or a file. It is commonly utilized in shell scripting to capture user
   input, create interactive scripts, and automate tasks that require user interaction. The read command
   allows you to assign input to variables, set time limits, and control the behavior of input reading,
   making it a versatile tool for scripting.

   This guide will demonstrate how to use the read command in Linux with practical examples. These
   examples will cover basic usage, reading multiple variables, setting timeouts, and using delimiters.
   By mastering the read command with these practical scenarios, you can create more interactive and
   dynamic shell scripts to enhance your automation tasks.

Syntax of the Read Command in Linux
Understanding the Basic Syntax and Options

   The read command in Linux is structured, yet its flexibility is key for various input scenarios in
   shell scripts. The fundamental syntax is:
read [options] [variable_name]

   Here, [options] modify the command's behavior, and [variable_name] stores the input. If you specify
   no variable, the input becomes the default REPLY variable.

Common Options in the Read Command
     * -p Custom Prompts: This option lets you set a prompt string, making the script interactive and
       guiding the user.
     * -t Timed Input: It introduces a timeout for the read operation, advancing the script
       automatically if input isn't provided within the specified period.
     * -s For Silent Mode: Essential for sensitive data, this mode hides the input from the terminal
       display.
     * -n For Character Limit: Restricts input to a set number of characters, ideal for controlling
       input length.
     * -r Disable Backslash Escaping: This treats backslashes as literal characters rather than escape
       characters.

Practical Examples of the read Command in Linux
   This section will explore practical examples of using the read command in Linux. This command is an
   essential tool for scriptwriters and system administrators, allowing them to prompt for input from a
   user or read a file line by line. Through these examples, you'll learn how to effectively utilize the
   read command in various scenarios.

Reading User Input
   The read command in Linux commonly captures user input, which is instrumental in scripts requiring
   user feedback or choices. Let's examine a simple example:
$> echo "Please enter your name: "
$> read name
$> echo "Welcome, $name!"

   In this example, the script prompts the user to enter their name. The read command captures the input
   and stores it in the variable name. Finally, the script greets the user with their input.

Reading Multiple Values
   The read The Linux cd command is also capable of reading multiple inputs into separate variables.
   This is useful when you need to collect several pieces of data at once.
$> echo "Enter your first and last name: "
$> read firstname lastname
$> echo "Hello, $firstname $lastname!"

   The script expects users to input their first and last names, separated by a space. The read command
   then assigns the first input to the variable first name and the second input to the last name.

Using a Custom Prompt with -p
   Instead of using echo to display a message before capturing input, you can use the -p option to
   specify a prompt directly within the read command:
$> read -p "Enter your age: " age
$> echo "You are $age years old."

   This approach streamlines the code by combining the prompt and input reading into a single command.

Hiding Input with -s
   For sensitive information, such as passwords, the read command in Linux offers the -s option to hide
   the user's input:
$> read -sp "Enter your password: " password
$> echo -e "\nPassword set."

   The -s option prevents the terminal from displaying the input characters. The echo -e "\n" is used to
   move to a new line after the input is entered, as -s also suppresses the new line typically generated
   by pressing Enter.

Reading from a File
   Beyond user input, the read command can read data from files. When combined with a loop, it can
   process each line of a file one at a time:
while IFS= read -r line; do
	echo "Line: $line"
done < "/path/to/file.txt"

   In this example, IFS= (Internal Field Separator) ensures that leading and trailing whitespace is
   preserved, and -r prevents backslashes from being interpreted as escape characters. The script reads
   each line from file.txt and echoes it.

Advanced Uses of the read Command in Linux
   Building on the foundational examples of the read command in Linux, we now focus on more
   sophisticated scenarios. These examples will showcase the command's adaptability in scripts for
   time-bound inputs, conditional execution, and processing complex data formats.

Implementing a Timeout for User Input
   In interactive scripts, it might be necessary to limit the duration of user input. The read command
   accommodates this through the -t flag, which specifies a timeout in seconds.

read -t 5 -p "Enter your preferred programming language (5 seconds): " language
if [ -z "$language" ]; then
	echo "Timeout reached. Defaulting to Python."
else
	echo "You chose $language."
fi

   This example allows the user 5 seconds to input their preferred programming language. If the user
   does not input anything within the timeout, the script defaults to Python.

Reading User Input in a Loop
   Sometimes, you may need to collect a series of inputs from the user until you meet a specific
   condition. Using the read command in a loop facilitates this process.

while true; do
	read -p "Enter a number (or 'quit' to exit): " num
	case $num in
		[0-9]*) echo "Number $num recorded." ;;
		"quit") break ;;
		*) echo "Invalid input. Please enter a number or 'quit'." ;;
	esac
done

   This script continuously prompts the user for a number until the user types "quit". It demonstrates
   how read can be effectively used within a loop to handle variable input scenarios.

Processing Delimited Data
   The read command can be combined with the -a flag to split input into an array based on a specific
   delimiter. This is particularly useful for processing comma-separated values (CSV) or similar data
   formats.

echo "Enter three favorite fruits separated by commas: "
IFS=',' read -ra fruits
for fruit in "${fruits[@]}"; do
	echo "Fruit: $fruit"
done

   Here, the input is expected to be a comma-separated list of fruits. The read command splits the input
   into an array of fruits and then iterates to display each fruit.

Reading Passwords Securely
   While we've covered the -s option for silent input, combining it with a prompt and a timeout can
   enhance security when reading sensitive information.
$> read -t 10 -sp "Enter your password (10 seconds to type): " password && echo
$> echo "Password securely read."

   This command prompts the user for a password, hides their input, and imposes a 10-second limit on
   entering the password. After that, it proceeds without echoing the password back.

Conditional Execution Based on Input
   Leveraging the read command for conditional execution based on user input can streamline
   decision-making processes within a script.

read -p "Do you want to continue? [Y/n]: " answer
case "$answer" in
	[Yy]* ) echo "Proceeding...";;
	[Nn]* ) echo "Operation aborted."; exit;;
	* ) echo "Please answer yes or no.";;
esac

   This script asks the user whether to continue. Depending on the input, it either proceeds with the
   operation, aborts it, or prompts for a clear answer, showcasing a practical use of read to control
   script flow based on user decisions.

Conclusion
   This guide has covered the essentials of the read command in Linux, from basic syntax to practical
   examples and advanced features. We've shown how it can read user input, process files, and handle
   data efficiently. My final tip is to experiment with the read command in your scripts. It's a
   versatile tool that can enhance your scripts' interactivity and dynamism. Keep practicing to unlock
   its full potential.
