What are the common Control combinations in a terminal setting

   I would like to have a good guide to the common Control key combinations in use in bash (and similar)
   shells and the combinations used by common programs in use in those shells.

   My particular motivation is to be able to run GNU screen on one computer, ssh to a second computer
   and use screen and irssi on that computer. So I need to use something other than Ctrl-A to control
   one of the screen sessions. So I need to know what are Control key combinations are safe to use.

   But I imagine this list would be useful for others who want to bind custom actions to Control key
   combinations.

   I reckon we'd be best to group the Control key combinations by application (eg. bash itself, screen,
   vim, emacs), to make it easy to spot the applications you use or can ignore. So please one
   application per answer - hope that works.

   Bash itself uses the GNU readline library, as do many other interactive command-line programs.
   Readline has the following default key bindings which mimic emacs behaviour:

   Moving about on the line:
     * Ctrl + A Go to the beginning of the line you are currently typing on
     * Ctrl + E Go to the end of the line you are currently typing on

   Editing text on the line:
     * Ctrl + U Clears the line before the cursor position. If you are at the end of the line, clears
       the entire line.
     * Ctrl + H Same as backspace
     * Ctrl + W Delete the word before the cursor
     * Ctrl + K Clear the line after the cursor
     * Ctrl + T Swap the last two characters before the cursor
     * Esc + T Swap the last two words before the cursor

   Other:
     * Ctrl + L Clears the Screen, similar to the clear command
     * Ctrl + R Let's you search through previously used commands
     * Ctrl + C Kill whatever you are running
     * Ctrl + D Exit the current shell
     * Ctrl + Z Puts whatever you are running into a suspended background process. fg restores it.

***
   Vim uses:
     * Ctrl-B back (up) one screen
     * Ctrl-D down half screen
     * Ctrl-E scroll text up (cursor doesn't move unless it has to)
     * Ctrl-F foreward (down) one screen
     * Ctrl-G show status
     * Ctrl-H backspace
     * Ctrl-J line down
     * Ctrl-L refresh screen
     * Ctrl-N move down one line (or scroll forward through autocompletions)
     * Ctrl-P move up one line (or scroll backward through autocompletions)
     * Ctrl-R redo (after undo)
     * Ctrl-T go to the file/code you were editing before the last tag jump
     * Ctrl-U up half screen
     * Ctrl-V enter visual block mode
     * Ctrl-W used for managing split windows
     * Ctrl-Y scroll text down (cursor doesn't move unless it has to)
