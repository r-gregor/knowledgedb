Using the History

The bash history is underestimated when it comes to usability. Here some nice stuff to do with the history.

SEARCH THE HISTORY
Every command is kept in the history. The simplest way to use the history is using the cursor-up/down keys. Most users are aware or [ctrl]-r. Usually you hit [ctrl]-r (r like reverse search) several times and miss the command, roll your eyes, hit [ctrl]-c and do it again. Why not using forward search with [ctrl]-s in such a case? Well, that suspends your terminal. It comes from the ancient times and is not needed anymore.

Turn off terminal suspension

        'echo "stty -ixon" >> /etc/profile'
Now you can search the history back and forward by using [ctrl]-r and [ctrl]-s.
