what is difference between bash piping commands and bash process substitution?

AI:
Piping redirects the output of one program to the input of another program. Command substitution changes the
command you enter by replacing the part with the command substitution with the output of the program. Piping
only works if the other program reads input from stdin (standard input channel).
