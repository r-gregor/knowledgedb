Bash script to send email

   Email is a very common communication medium in today's world now. Anyone can easily communicate or
   share any document with friends, family members, and colleagues by sending the email.    Generally,
   people use any free email server like Gmail, Yahoo, Hotmail etc. for sending the email. But you can
   send email from command line easily in Linux operating system. There are many ways to send email in
   Linux. Some common and easy ways to send email in Ubuntu operating system from the terminal is shown
   in this tutorial.

Initialization:
   Many Linux command is available to send email from the command line or by using a bash script. But
   any email sending command will not work if no SMTP server is set up properly in the system. You can
   setup your own SMTP server to send email from the command line or you can use any free SMTP server of
   any well-known email service provider like Gmail or Yahoo. SMTP server of a Gmail account is used in
   this tutorial. To do this task, you have to select a Gmail account and enable the option of 'Allow
   less secure apps' for that account to send the email. You can visit the following tutorial to enable
   this option.

   After enabling this option, you have to open the file '/etc/ssmtp/ssmtp.conf' with 'root' privilege
   and add the following lines at the end of the file. You have to set your email address to 'AuthUser'
   and your email password to 'AuthPass' to complete the setup.
   UseSTARTTLS=YES
   FromLineOverride=YES
   root=admin@example.com
   mailhub=smtp.gmail.com:587
   AuthUser=username@gmail.com
   AuthPass=password

Example-1: Using Sendmail Command
   One of the popular email sending commands of Linux is 'sendmail'. The user can easily send email from
   the command line by using this command. If Sendmail package is not installed in the system then run
   the following command to install the package.
   $ sudo apt install ssmtp

   Suppose, the email content is stored in a file named 'email.txt' with the following content. Here,
   the text after the 'Subject:' will be sent as email subject and the remaining part will be sent as
   email body.

   email.txt
   Subject: Sending email using sendmail
   Testing email body

   Run 'sendmail' command with recipient email address like the following command.
   $ sendmail username@gmail.com  < email.txt

Example-2: Using 'mail' Command
   The most common command for sending email in Linux is 'mail' command. This command is not installed
   on Ubuntu by default. Run the following command to install 'mail' command.
   $ sudo apt install mailutils

   The following command will show the version of this command if it is installed in the system.
   $ mail -V

   '-s' option is used in the 'mail' command to define the subject of the email. Run 'mail' command by
   '-s' option with email subject and the recipient email address like the following command. It will
   ask for Cc: address. If you don't want to use Cc: field then keep it blank and press enter. Type the
   message body and press Ctrl+D to send the email.
   $ mail -s 'subject' username@gmail.com

   If you want to add email message body in the command then use '<<<' operator like the following
   command.
   $ mail -s 'message subject' username@gmail.com <<< 'testing message body'

   You can also add the sender email address with  'mail' command by using the '-a' option. The
   following command will send the email with the subject, 'message subject', sender's name and email
   address, ''Admin<admin@example.com>' and recipient email address, 'username@gmail.com and
   message body, 'testing message'.
   $ mail -s 'message subject' -a From:Admin\<admin@example.com\>
   username@gmail.com <<< 'testing message'

   You can also send an email message body by using echo and pipe( | ) command. The following command
   uses the pipe (|) command to send the message body.
   $ echo "testing message" | mail -s "message subject" username@example.com

   Email can be sent to multiple recipients by using 'mail' command and adding the recipients' addresses
   by separating comma. The following command will be sent an email to two recipients.
   $ mail -s "Testing email"  username1@example.com , username2@example.com  < test.txt

Example-3: Using 'mutt' command
   Like 'mail' command, 'mutt' command is not installed on Ubuntu by default. Run the following command
   to install 'mutt' command.
   $ sudo apt  install mutt

   'mutt' command works similar to 'mail' command but 'mutt' command has own editor to send the email.
   Run the following command with the valid email address to send the email.
   $ echo "testing message" | mutt -s "Testing Email" username@example.com

   You can attach any file using the '-a' option with 'mail' or 'mutt' command.  The following command
   will attach the file items.txt while sending the email.
   $ echo "testing message" | mutt -s "message subject" -a items.txt -- username@gmail.com

Example-4: Using 'SSMTP' Command
   Another email command is 'ssmtp' command. If ssmtp is not installed before then install the package
   first. The installation command for ssmtp is shown in the example-1. ssmtp and sendmail commands work
   similarly.

   Run the following command with the valid email address. Type the email subject and body. Press ctrl+D
   to exit and send the email.
   $ ssmtp username@gmail.com

Example-5: Using mailx Command
   You can send HTML content as email body without just sending the text message. Create an HTML file
   named 'test.html' to use as a message body.

   test.html
   <html>
   <body>>
   <h3> Email Sending </h3>
   <font size="2" color="red">Testing Message body</font>
   <</body>
   </html>

   'mailx' command works like 'mail' command. You have to mention Content-Type as text/html to send HTML
   content as the message body in 'mailx' command. The following command will send the content of
   'test.html' file as the email message body.
   $ mailx -a 'Content-Type: text/html' -s "Sending email by using mailx "
    < test.html "username@gmail.com"

   When you will check the inbox of recipient email account then the list of emails will be shown as the
   following image.

Conclusion
   After practicing the above commands properly, hope the reader will be able to send email from the
   command line easily in Linux.
