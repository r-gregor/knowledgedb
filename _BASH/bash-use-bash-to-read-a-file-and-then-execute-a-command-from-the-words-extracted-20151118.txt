ï»¿Use bash to read a file and then execute a command from the words extracted

FILE:

hello
world

I would like to use a scripting language (BASH) to execute a command that reads each WORD in the FILE above and then plugs it into a command.

It then loops to the next word in the list (each word on new line). It stops when it reaches the end of the FILE.

Progression would be similar to this:

Read first WORD from FILE above

Plug word into command

command WORD > WORD

which will output it to a text file; with word as the name of the file.
Repeat this process, but with next to nth WORD (each on a new line).

Terminate process upon reaching the end of FILE above.

Result of BASH command on FILE above:

hello:

RESULT OF COMMAND UPON WORD hello
world:

You can use the "for" loop to do this. something like..

for WORD in `cat FILE`
do
   echo $WORD
   command $WORD > $WORD
done

normally i would ask what have you tried.
while read -r line 
do 
   command ${line} > ${line}.txt
done< "file"

---
IFS=$'\n';for line in `cat FILEPATH`; do command ${line} > ${line}; done
