[28]Linux Terminal: How to color the output in bash scripts

   An old [33]article by Todd Partridge (Gently) but still really useful if you are writing
   some bash scripts and want them more readable with some colors:

   Users who have been using Linux for awhile often learn that creating a basic script is a
   good way to run multiple, often-repeated commands. Adding a little color to scripts can
   additionally provide nice feedback. This can be done in a fairly straight-forward way by
   using the tput command.

   A common way of doing this is to define the colors that tput can produce by putting them at
   the beginning of the bash script:
#!/bin/bash
# scriptname - description of script

# Text color variables
txtund=$(tput sgr 0 1)          # Underline
txtbld=$(tput bold)             # Bold
bldred=${txtbld}$(tput setaf 1) #  red
bldblu=${txtbld}$(tput setaf 4) #  blue
bldwht=${txtbld}$(tput setaf 7) #  white
txtrst=$(tput sgr0)             # Reset
info=${bldwht}*${txtrst}        # Feedback
pass=${bldblu}*${txtrst}
warn=${bldred}*${txtrst}
ques=${bldblu}?${txtrst}

   When writing new scripts using templates with these variables already defined can quicken
   the creation process and help keep scripts organized

   If just needing to use tput colors for specific instances this script can display the tput
   definitions and their corresponding possibilities:
#!/bin/bash
# tputcolors

echo
echo -e "$(tput bold) reg  bld  und   tput-command-colors$(tput sgr0)"

for i in $(seq 1 7); do
  echo " $(tput setaf $i)Text$(tput sgr0) $(tput bold)$(tput setaf $i)Text$(tput sgr0) \
$(tput sgr 01)$(tput setaf $i)Text$(tput sgr0)  \$(tput setaf $i)"
done

echo ' Bold            $(tput bold)'
echo ' Underline       $(tput sgr 0 1)'
echo ' Reset           $(tput sgr0)'
echo

   You should get an output similar to this one:

   [34]tputcolors
