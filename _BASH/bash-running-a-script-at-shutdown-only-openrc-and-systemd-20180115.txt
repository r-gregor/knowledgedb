Running a shell script at shutdown only (not at reboot) – a comparison between OpenRC and systemd
January 13, 2018

   Gentoo Linux on my laptops uses OpenRC with SysVinit, whereas Lubuntu 17.10 on my family’s PC
   uses systemd. I have had to configure both Linux distributions to run a backup job at shutdown,
   so I thought it would be interesting to summarise the two approaches.

-->   OpenRC
   Create a Bash script /etc/local.d/10-run_on_shutdown.stop with the following contents:
#!/bin/bash
if [ `who -r | awk '{print $2}'` = "0" ]; then
    ########################################################################
    # Put Bash commands here to be executed on shutdown but not on reboot. #
    # For example, backup home directories to an external USB HDD.         #
    ########################################################################
fi

   From now on the script will run to completion when you shutdown the machine, but not when you reboot
   it.

-->   systemd
   1. Create a Bash script /usr/local/sbin/run_on_shutdown.sh with the following contents:
#!/bin/bash
REBOOT=$( systemctl list-jobs | egrep -q 'reboot.target.*start' && echo "rebooting" || echo "not_rebooting" )
if [ $REBOOT = "not_rebooting" ]; then
    ########################################################################
    # Put Bash commands here to be executed on shutdown but not on reboot. #
    # For example, backup home directories to an external USB HDD.         #
    ########################################################################
fi

   2. Create a unit file /etc/systemd/system/run_on_shutdown.service with the following contents:
[Unit]
Description=Run a script at shutdown but not at reboot
Before=shutdown.target
RequiresMountsFor=/home

[Service]
Type=oneshot
ExecStart=/bin/true
ExecStop=/usr/local/sbin/run_on_shutdown.sh
RemainAfterExit=true

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target

   I have assumed the Bash script is to backup /home, so change the directory list in
   ‘RequiresMountsFor=‘ if the script necessitates that other directories are still mounted – see
   ‘man systemd.unit‘ for details.

   3. Enable the unit file and start the service as follows:
user $ sudo systemctl enable run_on_shutdown.service
user $ sudo systemctl start run_on_shutdown.service

   From now on, the script will run to completion when you shutdown the machine, but not when you reboot
   it.

   A note on the systemd solution:

   There are plenty of posts on the Web suggesting how to run a script at shutdown in installations that
   use systemd, but the approaches either do not work in my case or they do not discriminate between
   shutting down and rebooting. For example, if you are wondering why I do not use
   ‘Conflicts=reboot.target‘ in the unit file, I found it does not prevent the Bash script from being
   launched when the system is rebooted (see the entry for ‘Conflicts=‘ in ‘man systemd.unit‘ for the
   functionality). If you are wondering why I do not simply place a script in
   /lib/systemd/system-shutdown/, it is because scripts in that directory are launched late in the
   shutdown process, after file systems have been mounted read-only. And if you are wondering why the
   Bash script tests if the system is rebooting (as distinct from shutting down) rather than the unit
   file being configured to do that, it is because the systemd shutdown target is active in any type of
   system termination, be it rebooting or halting, and it therefore does not help in discriminating
   between the termination types (see ‘man systemd.special‘). I tried several approaches in the unit
   file to see if it could be made to launch a Bash script when shutting down but not when rebooting,
   but the only solution that works for me in the Lubuntu 17.10 installation on my family’s PC uses the
   two files listed above working in conjunction with each other.
