How To Find My Public IP Address From Command Line On a Linux
November 25, 2018

   How do I find out my public IP address on the Linux and OS X Unix
   command line to use with my own bash shell script without using third
   party web site? Is there command-line option which will show my dynamic
   IP address on a Ubuntu or Fedora Linux?
   There are many ways to find out your public IP address or wan (Wide
   Area Network) IP on a Linux or Unix-like operating systems such as
   FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, Apple OS X, and
   others.[donotprint][/donotprint] This page explain how to find out your
   own IP address using command line options on an Ubuntu, Debian, CentOS
   Linux, macOS/OS X and Unix bash shell.

Explain IP addresses
   An IP is short for Internet Protocol. It is used to identify computers
   or mobile devices on the Internet. Each device connected to the
   Internet has an IP address. IP address can be used to personalize
   information.

Use dig command for determining my public IP address:
    1. Open the Terminal application.
    2. Type the following dig (domain information groper) command on a
       Linux, OS X, or Unix-like operating systems to see your own public
       IP address assigned by the ISP:
    3. dig +short myip.opendns.com @resolver1.opendns.com
    4. Or dig TXT +short o-o.myaddr.l.google.com @ns1.google.com
    5. You should see your IP address on screen. This is the fastest way
       to find out your IP address without using 3rd party site.

   You can try host command to see the same information:
   host myip.opendns.com resolver1.opendns.com
   
   You can also use the Google server to get the same info using dig
   command:
   dig TXT +short o-o.myaddr.l.google.com @ns1.google.com | awk -F'"' '{print $2}'

How do I store my IP address in a shell variable?
   The syntax is:
myip="$(dig +short myip.opendns.com @resolver1.opendns.com)"
echo "My WAN/Public IP address: ${myip}"

   Sample outputs:
My WAN/Public IP address: 74.86.144.194

Finding Public/WAN IP address on a router
   A few ADSL/Cable router allows you to login to your router using telnet
   or ssh:
telnet your-router-ip-here
ssh user@your-router-ip-here
telnet 192.168.0.254
ssh admin@192.168.1.254
[admin@dd-wrt ~]#  ifconfig eth1 | grep 'inet addr:'
[admin@dd-wrt ~]#  ip addr show nas01

Use 3rd party web-sites to get your IP
   Please note that I do not recommend following curl/wget method due to
   security reasons. You have been warned:
curl ifconfig.me
curl icanhazip.com
curl ipecho.net/plain
curl ifconfig.co
