Bash: How to iterate over associative array and print all key/value pairs
April 2016

   The values of an associative array are accessed using the following syntax ${ARRAY[@]}.

   To access the keys of an associative array in bash you need to use  an exclamation point right before
   the name of the array: ${!ARRAY[@]}.

   To iterate over the key/value pairs you can do something like the following example
# For every key in the associative array..
for KEY in "${!ARRAY[@]}"; do
	# Print the KEY value
	echo "Key: $KEY"

# Print the VALUE attached to that KEY
	echo "Value: ${ARRAY[$KEY]}"
done

   NOTE: The use of quotes around the array of keys ${!ARRAY[@]} in the for statement (plus the use of @
   instead of *) is necessary in case any keys include spaces.
