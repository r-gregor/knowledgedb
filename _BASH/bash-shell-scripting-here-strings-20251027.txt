Shell Scripting - Here Strings
23 Jul, 2025

   Here String is a kind of string that is used for input redirection from text or a variable. In
   here string Input will be mentioned in the same line within the quotes. the string inside the quotes
   is known as the Here string and Its command contains "<<<" (3 less than the symbol). Here string and
   a heredoc are extremely similar, but the former is a lot more simplified version of the latter.
   Because of this, a delimiter token is not required in this text. Whenever we need a quick technique
   to transform some strings into a command, it is typically preferred. It is also known as an ordinary
   string which is used for the purpose of input redirection, It's not a special kind of string. The
   execution contains only a few steps.

Basic Syntax:
   To construct a here-string, we use the "<<<" operator to redirect a string into a command.
   Concretely, the syntax is:
$> command <<< $DATA

   What it essentially does is expand the variable DATA and redirect the output string to the COMMAND.

Usage of Here Strings
   For input redirection from text or a variable, the here-string is utilized. On the same line, input
   is mentioned in single quotations (").

Example 1: Basic Usage

#!/bin/bash
wc -w <<< 'Hello GeeksforGeeks\n'

    In this example, the string It is "Hello GeeksforGeeks\n" is called the here-string.

Output:
2

   There are 2 words, so the output is been retrieved as 2.

Example 2: String with more words
#!/bin/bash
wc -w <<< 'Welcome to GFG a helping platform for CS Students'

   In this example, the string "Welcome to GFG a helping platform for CS Students" is called the
   here-string.

Output:
9

   There are 9 words, so the output is been retrieved as 9.

Example 3: Here String with Parameter
if grep -q "txt" <<< "$VAR"; then
	echo "$VAR contains the substring sequence \"txt\""
fi

   In the above example, the here-string is present with a parameter $VAR which is working as a
   parameter.

Example 4: Escape Special Characters in Here String
word=$'HELLO\ngfg'
echo "$WORD"

   It's a kind of special character which is sometimes used in the here-string

   The above example is here-string with Escape Special Characters and it's Escaping some characters.
