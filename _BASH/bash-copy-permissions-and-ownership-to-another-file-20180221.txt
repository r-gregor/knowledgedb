How to Copy File Permissions and Ownership to Another File in Linux
February 20, 2018
 
   Assuming you have two files or you have just created a new file and want it to have the same
   permissions and ownership of an older file.

   In this article, we will show you how to copy permissions and ownership from one file to another file
   in Linux using chmod and chown commands respectively.

Copy File Permissions to Another File
   To copy file permissions from one file to another file, use chmod command with the --reference switch
   in the following syntax, where reference_file is the file from which permissions will be copied
   rather than specifying mode (i.e octal or numerical mode permissions) for file.
$ chmod --reference=reference_file file

   For example,
$ ls -l users.list
$ ls -l keys.list
$ sudo chmod --reference=users.list keys.list
$ ls -l keys.list

Copy File Ownership to Another File
   Likewise, to copy ownership from another file, use chown command with the --reference switch as well
   using the following syntax, where reference_file is file from which owner and group will be copied
   rather than specifying owner:group values for file.
$ chown --reference=reference_file file

   For example,
$ ls -l keys.list
$ touch api.list
$ ls -l keys.list
$ sudo chown --reference=keys.list api.list
$ ls -l api.list

   You can also copy file permissions and ownership from one file to multiple files as shown.
$ sudo chmod --reference=users.list users1.list users2.list users3.list
$ sudo chown --reference=users.list users1.list users2.list users3.list

   For more information, refer to the chown and chmod man pages.
$ man chown
$ man chmod
