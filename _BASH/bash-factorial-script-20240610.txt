Bash Script to Calculate Factorial of a Number

   Here are a few sample example bash scripts to display the Fibonacci sequence based on a given input.

Exercise
   In this Bash practice exercise, write a shell script that accepts a non-negative number and shows its
   factorial as output.

   ðŸ’¡Hint: Factorial is calculated in this fashion:
N! = N x (N-1) x (N-2) x (N-3) x ... x 3 x 2 1

   Remember that the factorial of 0 is 1. And you cannot have a factorial of negative numbers.

Test data
   If you input 5, you should get the following (5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1):
120

   If you input 7, you should get the following:
5040

   A programming challenge can be solved in more than one way. The solution presented here is for
   reference purposes only. You may have written a different program and it could be correct as well.

Solution: Factorial bash script using recursive function
   Here's a sample bash scripting for getting factorial of a given number using only a for loop.

   I have added the option step for checking that non-negative numbers are not enetered.

<code>
#!/bin/bash

read -p "Enter a non-negative number: " num

if [ $num -lt 0 ]; then
	echo "You entered a negative number"
	exit
fi

fact=1
for (( i=1; i<=$num; i++ )); do
	fact=$(($fact*$i))
done

echo "$num! is: $fact"
</code>

Solution 2: Factorial script using factorial in bash
   Here's a bash shell script that uses the concept of recursion and function:

<code>
#!/bin/bash

read -p "Enter a non-negative number: " num

if [ $num -lt 0 ]; then
	echo "You entered a negative number"
	exit
fi

factorial () {
	if [ $1 -le 1 ]; then
		echo 1
	else
		last=$(factorial $(( $1 -1)))
		echo $(( $1 * last ))
	fi
}

echo -n "$num! is: "
factorial $num
</code>

   Notice the use of echo commands with and without -n? It is used to stop echo from automatically
   adding a newline.

Concepts to revise
   The solutions discussed here use some terms, commands and concepts and if you are not familiar with
   them, you should learn more about them.
