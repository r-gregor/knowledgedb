X resources

   X resources file is a user-level configuration dotfile, typically located at
   ~/.Xresources. It can be used to set configuration parameters for X client applications. Among
   other things, it can be used to:
     * configure terminal preferences-e.g. terminal colors,
     * set DPI, anti-aliasing, hinting and other X font settings,
     * change the X resources cursor theme (Xcursor theme),
     * theme XScreenSaver,
     * configure X applications-such as rxvt-unicode, xorg-xclock and xpdf.

Installation
   Install the xorg-xrdb package for X server resource database utility and xorg-docs for
   X.org documentations.

Configuration
   X(7) § RESOURCES and XrmGetDatabase(3) § FILE SYNTAX provide detailed information on X
   resources mechanism and file syntax.

   ~/.Xresources is a conventional file name, xrdb does not claim it. You can use any other file names,
   like ~/.config/X11/Xresources and ~/.config/X11/Xresources.d/application-name (also see #Samples
   and #Include files).

Basic syntax
   The syntax of an X resources file is a sequence of resource lines as follows:
application_name.Class.resourceName: value
      application_name.resourceName: value
                 Class.resourceName: value
      application_name*resourceName: value
                      *resourceName: value

   application_name and Class substrings will never contain a dot (.), the resourceName substring may
   contain a dot. For example, Dialog.bodyFont is a XScreenSaver internal resource that is specified
   to set the body font and fallback font:
xscreensaver-auth.default.Dialog.bodyFont: times new roman 12, dejavu serif 12

   application_name
          The name of the application, such as urxvt, xpdf, xterm, etc. Also may be called the instance
          name.

   Class
          The classification used to group resources together. Class names are typically uppercase.

   resourceName
          The name of the resource whose value is to be set. Resources are typically lowercase with
          uppercase concatenation.

   value
          The actual value of the resource. This can be one of three types:

          + Integer (whole numbers)
          + Boolean (true/false, yes/no, on/off)
          + String (a string of characters) - for example a word (white), a color (#ffffff), or a path
            (/usr/bin/firefox)

   delimiters
     * A dot (.) is a tight binding and is used to separate immediately adjacent components (in other
       words, to signify each step down into the hierarchy) - in the above example we start at
       application name, then descend into Class, and finally into the resource itself.
     * An asterisk (*) is a loose binding and is used to represent any number of components, including
       none.
     * A colon (:) is used to separate the resource name from the value.

   Note
     * From resource file syntax point of view, everything before a colon (:) is a resource name. From
       the user perspective, we often call resource only the rightmost component. In other words,
       resource name is a string consisted of application name, Class and resource name substrings. That
       might be the source of confusion.
     * Resource naming schema is totally application-dependent. While one application might use
       application_name.Class.resourceName, another might understand application_name.resourceName and
       Class.resourceName only.

Wildcard matching
   Question mark (?) and asterisk (*) can be used as wildcards, making it easy to write a single rule
   that can be applied to many different applications or elements. ? is used to match any single
   component name, while * is used to represent any number of intervening components including none.

   Using the previous example, if you want to apply the same font to all programs (not just
   XScreenSaver) that contain the class name Dialog which contains the resource name headingFont, you
   could write:
?.Dialog.headingFont:     -*-fixed-bold-r-*-*-*-100-*-*-*-*-iso8859-1

   If you want to apply this same rule to all programs that contain the resource headingFont, regardless
   of its class, you could write:
*headingFont:    -*-fixed-bold-r-*-*-*-100-*-*-*-*-iso8859-1

   Note
     * Question mark (?) is like component name, so binding character - dot (.) or asterisk (*) - next
       to it is required.
     * Asterisk (*) is a binding character itself, there is no need in placing dot next to it, and a
       sequence of dot(s) and asterisk(s) is replaced with a single asterisk during file processing.

   See [https://man.archlinux.org/man/XrmGetResource.3#MATCHING_RULES]XrmGetResource(3) § MATCHING RULES for
   more information.

Comments
   Lines starting with an exclamation mark (!) are ignored, for example:
! The following rule will be ignored because it has been commented out
!Xft.antialias: true

   Note
     * The exclamation mark must be the first character on the line.
     * If you have a C preprocessor, such as GNU CPP (gcc), installed you can use
       C-style (// and /* ... */) comments (also see #Samples).

   The two-character sequence \newline (backslash followed by newline), which allows a value to be
   broken across multiple lines, is also recognized inside the comments. In the following sample all
   four lines are commented out, despite only one exclamation mark is used:
! URxvt.font: xft:Input Mono:size=13:style=Regular, \
              xft:Font Awesome 6 Free:style=Solid,  \
              xft:Segoe UI Symbol:style=Regular,    \
              xft:Noto Emoji:style=Regular

Include files
   To spread resource configuration across multiple files (e.g. to use its own file for each
   application), use C preprocessor #include directive:
~/.config/X11/Xresources
#include "Xresources.d/fonts"
#include "Xresources.d/rxvt-unicode"
#include "Xresources.d/xscreensaver"
#include "Xresources.d/xterm"

   If files that are referenced with #include are not reachable from the applied configuration file
   directory, you need to pass a directory to search for:
$> xrdb -load -I${HOME}/.config/X11 ~/.Xresources

Default settings
   To see the default settings for your installed X11 applications, look in
   /usr/share/X11/app-defaults/.

   Detailed information on program-specific resources is usually provided in the man page for the
   program. xterm(1) § RESOURCES is a good example, as it contains a list of X resources and their
   default values.

   To see the currently loaded resources:
$> xrdb -query -all

Usage

Load resource file
   Resources are stored in the X server, so have to only be read once. They are also accessible to
   remote X11 clients (such as those forwarded over SSH).

   Load a resource file (such as the conventional .Xresources), replacing any current settings:
$> xrdb ~/.Xresources

   Load a resource file, and merge with the current settings:
$> xrdb -merge ~/.Xresources

   Note
     * Most [https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Display_manager]Display managers load the ~/.Xresources file on
       login.
     * The older ~/.Xdefaults file is read when an X11 program starts, but only if xrdb has not been used in
       the current session. 

xinitrc
   If you are using a copy of the default xinitrc as your .xinitrc it already merges ~/.Xresources.

   If you are using a custom one, add:
.xinitrc
[[ -f ~/.Xresources ]] && xrdb -merge -I$HOME ~/.Xresources

   Note Do not background the xrdb command within ~/.xinitrc. Otherwise, programs launched after xrdb
   may look for resources before it has finished loading them.

Getting resource values
   If you want to get the value of a resource (for example if you want to use it in a bash script) you
   can use xgetres^AUR:
$> xgetres xscreensaver.Dialog.headingFont
-*-fixed-bold-r-*-*-*-100-*-*-*-*-iso8859-1

Troubleshooting

Parsing errors
   Display managers such as GDM may use the --nocpp argument for xrdb.

No output from xrdb -query
   It is not rare for xrdb -query to output nothing. Try following #Load resource file and
   #xinitrc from above. And note some of the files mentioned there could be empty.
