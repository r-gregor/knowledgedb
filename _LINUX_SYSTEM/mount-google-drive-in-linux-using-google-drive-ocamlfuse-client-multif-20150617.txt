How to Mount Google Drive in Linux Using “Google Drive OCamlfuse” Client 1/3

   Google Drive is a cloud storage service owned by Google Inc. Google Drive allows user to
   edit documents (including Spreadsheets and Presentations), share, synchronize and store in
   the cloud. It is free to use Google Drive and all you need is a Google/Gmail Account.
   Introduced in the year 2012, Google Drive presently have a total of 240 million+ monthly
   users.

Technical aspects of Google Drive

    1. Google Offers initial 15GB of online storage for free that is used by Gmail, Google+
       photos and Google Drive in combination.
    2. Post utilization of 15GB of online storage you can buy monthly subscription by paying a
       little amount and you can own a maximum of 30 TB space per account. However there is no
       limitation for the number of accounts you can own.
    3. Google Driver Viewer has support for viewing the file types for most of the formats.
    4. There are a number of Third-party apps that lets you access Google Drive. One such
       extension for Google Chrome will let you access Google Drive even when offline.
    5. Document Limit for Google Dock – A document must not exceed 1,024,000 characters
       regardless of font, page and size and should not exceed 50 MB.
    6. A spreadsheet must not be larger than 20 MB and a Presentation slide should be within
       100 MB.

Why Prefer Google Drive over Traditional Storage

   You need Google Drive because you need to have access to your documents, pictures,
   Spreadsheets, Presentation and other files all the time when required. You do not need to
   carry a physical hard Drive / USB flash Drive to carry files and hence there is no risk of
   losing your files.

   No risk of virus infection or attack by a hacker, as your files are safe in the Google
   Cloud with strong password. Edit and View files on Desktop, Laptop, Latest Mobile Phones
   and Tablets, etc… anytime, anyplace, any platform and whatever.

   To Sync files between Google Drive and local machine, you need a Google Drive Client. There
   are a lots of Google Drive client for Systems like Windows, Mac OS X, Android, iOS but
   unfortunately there is no any official client software for Linux.

   There are a few open source third party tools that lets you mount Google Drive on you Linux
   System, but here we’re introducing yet another popular tool called google-drive-ocamlfuse,
   which allows you to mount your Google Drive under your Linux filesystem to access your
   files more easily.

$ google-drive-ocamlfuse ~/google-drive

   You may check the mount point and disk space usages of your mounted Google Drive using df
   command as shown below.

   If you have more than one account, you can run use following command.
$ google-drive-ocamlfuse -label label [mountpoint]

   The label options is used to distinguish different accounts under directory ~/.gdfuse/label
   to host configuration, application state, and file cache.

   Do remember no files are shared among different accounts, so that you can have a different
   configuration for each Google account.

   11. To unmount the Google Drive, you have to run:
$ fusermount -u ~/google-drive

   For more options and help, run google-drive-ocamlfuse -help command to get all the
   available commands and switches.

Mount Google Drive Automatically in Linux

   You may mount more than one drive at a time and also mount Google drive automatically at
   boot.

   12. create a shell script gdfuse in the directory /usr/bin as root, with the below content.
#!/bin/bash
su $USERNAME -l -c "google-drive-ocamlfuse -label $1 $*"
exit 0

   13. Make it executable.
# chmod 755 /usr/bin/gdfuse

   14. Create mountpoint say /mnt/gdrive and give ownership to user ‘avi‘.
# mkdir /mnt/gdrive
# chown avi.avi /mnt/gdrive

   15. Next, open and edit file /etc/fstab and add below line at the bottom. Save and exit.
gdfuse#default   /mnt/gdrive    fuse    uid=1000,gid=1000       0       0

   Take extra care of ‘uid‘ and ‘gid‘. Change it as user’s uid and gid.

   16. To mount the google drive now, run:
# mount /mnt/gdrive

   For more information about how to include and use multiple Google accounts, see the
   [35]google-drive-ocamlfuse wiki.

   That’s all for now. Installing from source is not a big deal as well and it is pretty
   straight forward, as tested on Debian. What you think about the project and its setup. Also
   there is no answer from Google on official Drive client even after 3 years, so what do you
   think. Is Google Drive Ocamlfuse a life savior? Please let us know your valuable thought in
