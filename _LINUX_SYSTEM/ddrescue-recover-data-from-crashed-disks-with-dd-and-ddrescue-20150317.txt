Linux: Save and Recover Data From Crashed Disks With ddrescue Command Like a Pro

   by [12]nixCraft on May 3, 2006 · [13]27 comments· LAST UPDATED October 7, 2014

   GNU ddrescue is a program that copies data from one file or block device (hard disk, cd/dvd-rom, etc)
   to another, it is a tool to help you to save data from crashed partition i.e. it is a data recovery
   tool. It tries to read and if it fails it will go on with the next sectors, where tools like dd will
   fail. If the copying process is interrupted by the user it is possible to continue at any position
   later. It can copy backwards.
   This program is useful to rescue data in case of I/O errors, because it does not necessarily abort or
   truncate the output. This is why you need to use this program and not the [18]dd command. I have
   recovered much data from many disks (CD/hard disk/software raid) over the years using GNU ddrescue on
   Linux. I highly recommend this tool to Linux sysadmins.

Complete!

   You can directly download ddrescue from the official GNU [22]project web site and compile it on Linux
   or Unix-like systems.

A note about using ddrescue safely

    1. You need to use a logfile to resume a rescue.
    2. Never ever run ddrescue on a read/write mounted partition.
    3. Do not try to repair a file system on a drive with I/O errors.
    4. Be careful about destination partition/device, any data stored there will be overwritten.

How do I use ddrescue command?

   In this example rescue a /dev/sda to /dev/sdb

     ## No need to partition /dev/sdb beforehand, but if the partition table on /dev/sda ##
     ## is damaged, you will need to recreate it somehow on /dev/sdb. ##
     ddrescue -f -n /dev/sda /dev/sdb logfile
     ddrescue -d -f -r3 /dev/sda /dev/sdb logfile
     ## get list of partitions on a /dev/sdb ##
     fdisk /dev/sdb

     ## check for errors ##
     fsck -v -f /dev/sdb1
     fsck -v -f /dev/sdb2

Understanding ddrescue command options

     * -f : Overwrite output device or partition.
     * -n : Do not try to split or retry failed blocks.
     * -d : Use direct disc access for input file.
     * -r3 : Exit after given three (3) retries (use -1 as infinity retries).
     * -b2048 : Sector size of input device [default is set to 512].

Example: Rescue a partition in /dev/sda3 to /dev/sdb3 in Linux


 ## You need to create the sdb2 partition with fdisk first. sdb2 should be of appropriate type and size ##
     ddrescue -f -n /dev/sda2 /dev/sdb2 logfile
     ddrescue -d -f -r3 /dev/sda2 /dev/sdb2 logfile
     e2fsck -v -f /dev/sdb2
     mount -o ro /dev/sdb2 /mnt
## Rread rescued files from /mnt ##
     cd /mnt
     ls -l
## Copy files using rsync ##
     rsync -avr . vivek@server1.cyberciti.biz:/data/resuced/wks01

Example: Rescue/recover a DVD-ROM in /dev/dvdom on a Linux

   The syntax is:

     ddrescue -n -b2048 /dev/dvdrom dvd-image logfile
     ddrescue -d -b2048 /dev/dvdrom dvd-image logfile

   Please note that if there are no errors (errsize is zero), dvd-image now contains a complete image of
   the DVD-ROM and [23]you can write it to a blank DVD-ROM on a Linux based system:
   # growisofs -Z /dev/dvdrom=/path/to/dvd-image

Example: Resume failed rescue

   In this example, while rescuing the whole drive /dev/sda to /dev/sdb, /dev/sda freezes up at position
   XYZFOOBAR (troubled sector # 7575757542):

 ## /dev/sda freezes here ##
 ddrescue -f /dev/hda /dev/hdb logfile
 ## So restart /dev/sda or reboot the server ##
 reboot
 ## Restart copy at a safe distance from the troubled sector # 7575757542 ##
 ddrescue -f -i 7575757542 /dev/sda /dev/sdb logfile
 ## Copy backwards down to the troubled sector # 7575757542 ##
 ddrescue -f -R /dev/sda /dev/sdb logfile

A note about dd_rescue command and syntax

   On Debian / Ubuntu and a few other distro you end up installing other utility called dd_rescue.
   dd_rescue is a program that copies data from one file or block device to another, it is a tool to
   help you to save data from crashed partition.

Examples: dd_rescue

   To make exact copy of /dev/sda (damaged) to /dev/sdb (make sure sdb is empty) you need to type
   following command:
   # ddrescue /dev/sda /dev/sdb
   Naturally, next step is to run fsck on /dev/sdb partition to recover/save data. Remember do not touch
   originally damaged /dev/sda. If this procedure fails you can send your disk to professional data
   recovery service. For example if /home (user data) is on /dev/sda2, you need to run a command on
   /dev/sdb2:
   # fsck /dev/sdb2

   Once fsck run, mount /dev/sdb2 somewhere and see if you can access the data:
   # mount /dev/sdb2 /mnt/data
   Finally, take backup using tar or any other command of your own choice. ddrescue command supports
   tons of options, read man page for more information:
   # man dd_rescue
   OR see gnu/ddrescue command man page:
   # man ddrescue
