   So you have just upgraded or installed a new Ubuntu desktop, and want to add some extra
   useful and essential applications on it? Good. But, you should put some extra effort to
   find and install all those applications to get a near perfect Ubuntu desktop. What are you
   going to do? Are you going to manually search and install each applications by downloading
   the respective .deb packages or by adding some PPA repositories and install all of the
   essential apps? I bet it’s a quite time consuming process, and also someone may not know
   even what applications they should install to get a perfect desktop.

   Well, what if a single tool can do this all for you with a couple of mouse clicks? Yeah,
   you got my point now. There is an interesting and a very important tool is available that
   can be used to install all essential and popular applications with a single or couple of
   mouse clicks? I know you’re getting curious to know. That tool is called “Ubuntu After
   Install”.

   Ubuntu After Install is a tool that can be used to install some of the best and essential
   software after installing the Ubuntu desktop. It has a bunch of useful applications, and
   will automate the installation process on a newly installed machine to get near perfect
   desktop. I would not say a complete desktop for all users, but a near perfect desktop. This
   tool saves your time and effort, and installs all latest versions of softwares by
   automatically adding the respective PPA’s to keep the installed softwares up to date on
   your Ubuntu system.

   The complete list of applications that can be installed using Ubuntu After Install is given
   below:
     * Ubuntu Restricted Extras: video codecs and Flash Plugin
     * libdvdcss to enable DVD playback
     * Unity Tweak Tool to tweak your desktop settings
     * Variety is a feature rich wallpaper changer for Ubuntu
     * Google Chrome is arguably the best browser available
     * LibreOffice is the complete open source Office software replacement
     * Skype offers text, voice and video chat
     * Grive Tools will sync your Google Drive to your computer
     * DropBox will sync your DropBox cloud storage
     * VLC will play any video file you can imagine
     * XBMC is a complete home media center experience
     * Radio Tray will stream online radio to your desktop
     * GIMP is powerful image editing software
     * Darktable allows photographers to process RAW files
     * Inkscape is vector based illustration and graphics editor
     * Scribus professional quality desktop publishing software

Install ‘Ubuntu After Install’ On Ubuntu 12.04 and newer

   Add the ‘Ubuntu After Install’ PPA and install it as shown below.
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:thefanclub/ubuntu-after-install
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install ubuntu-after-install

   Alternatively, you can download the .deb file [39]here, and manually install it yourself.

Usage

   After installing Ubuntu-After-Install, launch it either from Unity Dash or Menu.

   [40]Menu_001

   This is how Ubuntu-after-install looked after launching it.

   [41]Ubuntu After Install 2.4 beta_002

   As you see in the above screenshot, it will display all useful softwares. The softwares
   that already has been installed will not be selected by default and marked with green
   colour dot. If particular software is not available for your Ubuntu version, then it will
   be marked with Red colour dot. And, the softwares marked in orange colour will be
   re-installed/upgraded. Clear?

   Now, select the softwares that you want to install and hit the button Install Now. The PPA
   of the selected softwares will added automatically and the respective softwares will be
   installed on your system. Sounds good, isn’t it?

   For example, here I want to install only the p7zip compression utility on my ubuntu 14.04
   system. So i selected p7zip package, and unchecked all of others. To begin the
   installation, just hit the Install Now button.

   [42]Ubuntu After Install 2.4 beta_003

   Now, the install will automatically add the PPA of p7zip on your system and install it.
   Everything will be done automatically on background. So you don’t need anything to do.
   Just, be relax and watch the installation.

   [43]Ubuntu After Install 2.4 beta_004

   If the software has been successfully installed, it will be marked as green colour dot.
   Please keep in mind that installing all applications at once will take a while to complete
   depending upon your Internet connection speed, and it is highly not advisable to interrupt
   the install process once it has begun.

Conclusion

   We have featured the [44]Ubuntu Tweak tool a couple of days before. Ubuntu Tweak and Ubuntu
   After Install tools do the same job, but Ubuntu Tweak has a lot of features over Ubuntu
   After Install. Ubuntu After Tool is only intended to install all best and daily usage
   softwares on your machine, whereas Ubuntu Tweak tool will do couple extra stuffs such as
   customizing your Ubuntu desktop and more.

   Stop wasting your precious time by searching “things to do after installing Ubuntu” related
   stuffs on the web. Ubuntu Tweak and Ubuntu After Install are both definitely will help for
   those who are searching for things to do after installing Ubuntu desktop. Go, get it and do
   things more quickly and precisely. Good luck!

   That’s all for now. Hope it helps.

   Cheers!

       I’ve been using Unity for years, no problems. I still don’t get these people that say
       it slows them down at all. I’ve never had a problem with it. As long as I can hit my
       SUPER key and type the name of the program I need I’ve been fine.
     * www.kashu.org
       That’s a great tool!
       Please add the following software: PAC Manager, preload, Audacious,
       indicator-multiload, apt-fast, SimpleScreenRecorder, Wireshark, uGet, meld, conky,
       UNetbootin, I-Nex, TLP, Silverlight, fcitx, etc. Thanks. More:

       I use Ubuntu Studio. In my opinion XFCE looks better than Unity and eats less resources
       than the resource hog that Canonical pushes on you, and that low latency kernel is good
       for audio.
     * SK
       Ofcourse Unity is slow. That’s why I use Lubuntu for my regular usage. It uses less
       resources than Unity and other DE’s.
     * SK
       yeah, it’s funny. The developer of this tool thinks Chrome is better than Firefox. How
       pity!!
     * michael santos
       Ubuntu isa free software. If you dont like it dont use it.
