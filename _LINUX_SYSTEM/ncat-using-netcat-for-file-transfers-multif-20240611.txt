Using Netcat for File Transfers

   Netcat is like a swiss army knife for geeks. It can be used for just about anything involving TCP or
   UDP. One of its most practical uses is to transfer files. Non *nix people usually don't have SSH
   setup, and it is much faster to transfer stuff with netcat then setup SSH. netcat is just a single
   executable, and works across all platforms (Windows,Mac OS X, Linux).

   On the receiving end running,
$> nc -l -p 1234 > out.file

   will begin listening on port 1234.

   On the sending end running,
$> nc -w 3 [destination] 1234 < out.file

   will connect to the receiver and begin sending file.

   For faster transfers if both sender and receiver has some basic *nix tools installed, you can
   compress the file during sending process,

   On the receiving end,
$> nc -l -p 1234 | uncompress -c | tar xvfp -

   On the sending end,
$> tar cfp - /some/dir | compress -c | nc -w 3 [destination] 1234

   A much cooler but less useful use of netcat is, it can transfer an image of the whole hard drive over
   the wire using a command called dd.

   On the sender end run,
$> dd if=/dev/hda3 | gzip -9 | nc -l 3333

   On the receiver end,
$> nc [destination] 3333 | pv -b > hdImage.img.gz

   Be warned that file transfers using netcat are not encrypted, anyone on the network can grab what you
   are sending, so use this only on trusted networks.

Transferring a File Using NC
March 18, 2024


1. Introduction
Transferring files between systems is a common task in the world of networking and system administration. In
this article, we'll explore how to transfer files with the netcat (or nc) command in Linux. The simplicity
and power of netcat offer a valuable solution for sharing files seamlessly across systems.

First, we'll begin by setting up the transfer scenario, involving a sender and a receiver system. Then, we'll
learn the necessary commands for both sides and outline the details of how the transfer works. Lastly, we'll
ensure that the file arrives intact at the receiver end without tampering.

Without any further ado, let's get into the nitty-gritty of it.

2. netcat
netcat is a networking utility that performs various tasks, including port scanning, banner grabbing, and
file transfers. Its simplicity and flexibility make it a favorite among administrators for various
networking operations. One of the key features of netcat is its ability to create client-server connections
and forward data between them.

3. Setting Up the File Transfer
First, look at the netcat command's installation status on the Linux CLI. We can use the which command to
verify the installation of netcat:

receiver $> which nc
receiver $>

If it's not there, we can employ the apt command for the installation of the netcat command on the system:

receiver $> sudo apt install nc -y

Then, let's use the which command again to identify the path of the installation:

receiver $> which nc
/usr/bin/nc
receiver $>

Here, the netcat command is installed in the /usr/bin/nc path.

4. File Transfer Process
Now that the system is ready, let's initiate the file transfer. Obviously, the sender will utilize the
netcat command to initiate the transfer, while the receiver will accept and save the incoming file.

To begin with, we'll log in to the sender's server and navigate to the directory containing the file that
needs to be transferred.

For this, we first need to ensure the file is available on the appropriate path for transfer. In this case,
we're using the sample_file_transfer.iso from the current path:

sender $> nc -w 2 172.31.200.52 9899 < sample_file_transfer.iso
sender $>

The < operator is used to send the data from the sender's netcat session over port 9899.

The ls command displays the list of files in the current path:

sender $> ls
sample_file_transfer.iso
sender $>

Now, in order to receive the file, we'll use the netcat command with the IP address of the receiver where we
want to send the desired file.

Further, let's open the port for the file transfer on the receiver's server using the netcat command. In
addition, we'll use the -l flag in the receiver's command to indicate that netcat should be receptive to the
incoming connections:

receiver $> nc -l 9899 > sample_file_transfer.iso

...
... Intentionally left the space ...
...

Likewise, the > operator is used to receive the data from the sender's netcat session over port 9899.
Now, we've successfully transferred the sample_file_transfer.iso file from the sender to the receiver's
system in the mentioned path.

5. File Data Verification
Now, the file transfer is complete. The next step is to verify whether the transfer was free of errors. We
do this by checking the md5 checksums of the original file on the sender's system and the received file.

Let's use the md5sum command to get the hash value of the original file from the sender's server:
sender $> md5sum sample_file_transfer.iso
c6779ec2960296ed9a04f08d67f64422

Subsequently, let's obtain the hash value of the copied file from the receiver's server:
receiver $> md5sum sample_file_transfer.iso
c6779ec2960296ed9a04f08d67f64422

As we see, the hash values from the sender and receiver match, which assures that the transfer was accurate.

6. Conclusion
In summary, we learned about the process of transferring files between Linux systems using the netcat command.
Next, we saw how to set up a sender and receiver, with the sender using netcat to initiate the process and
the receiver tending to the incoming data.

Lastly, we also covered the importance of verifying the success of the transfer and the method to confirm
the accuracy of the received file.

   Using Netcat for File Transfers

   Netcat is like a swiss army knife for geeks. It can be used for just about anything involving TCP or

Destination
   On the receiving (destination) terminal, run:
$> nc -l -p 1234 > out.file

   For mac users, use
$> nc -l 1234 > out.file

   This will begin listening incomming data on port 1234.

Origin
   On the sending terminal, run:
$> nc -w 3 [destination ip address] 1234 < out.file

   will connect to the receiver and begin sending file. The -w 3 option stands for a 3 seconds timeout.

How to Send a File Using Netcat and Then Keep the Connection Alive
08 Dec, 2023

   Netcat (NC) is a popular networking utility tool for reading and writing data across network
   connections using TCP or UDP protocols. It can be used for both attack and security, in the case of
   attacking. It helps us to debug the network along with investigating it. It runs on all operating
   systems. Netcat (NC) is a well-known systems administration application that might be utilized to
   trade records and hold associations open for additional verbal trade between frameworks.

Getting Started with Netcat ( NC )
   Netcat (NC) is mostly used in Network Security, Network Administration, and cyber Operations while
   netcat has many potential uses, it sees most of its utilization in security, networking, programming,
   infrastructure troubleshooting, and cloud/virtualization environments. Its flexibility makes it one
   of the most multipurpose networking utilities available.

Prerequisites :
   On the Computer Sending the File (Sender):
     * Install a program called Netcat. This lets you use commands like "nc" to connect to other
       computers.
     * Have the file you want to send saved on your computer already.
     * Know the IP address of the receiving computer. This is a number that identifies it.
     * Know what port number the receiving computer is listening on. Think of ports like numbered doors
       - you need to knock on the right one for them to answer!

   On the Computer Receiving the File (Receiver):
     * Install the Netcat program.
     * Run a command to listen for connections on a chosen port. Like "nc -l 1234".
     * Make sure that the port number can accept connections from the sender's computer through any
       firewalls.
     * You can save whatever is received directly to a file by adding on "> received_file.txt"

   For the Network:
     * The port number must be open between the two computers so they can connect.
     * The network connection itself must be reliable.

   Other Important Things:
     * The sender and receiver need to agree on which port number to use beforehand.
     * Know how big the file is before sending it same so the receiver has enough disk space.

   Let me know if any part needs more explanation! I tried to simplify the key points as best I could.

Required settings and configurations :
   1. Firstly, you need to check whether NetCat is installed or not in your system. To check that use
   the following Command :
$> nc -h

   If you see the following output then netcat is preinstalled in your system.

   2. If NetCat is not installed in your system then you need to use the following Command :
$> sudo apt-get install netcat
or
$> sudo apt-get -y install netcat

   You need to enter the password after entering the above command as you need to give root user
   privileges. 'sudo' command gives superuser privileges to the command.'apt-get' command is used to
   handle the package utility.

   Hooray !! You have Successfully installed the NetCat (NC) tool in your System.

How to send a file using netcat and then keep the connection alive :
   Here is a step-by-step explanation on how to send a file using netcat and keep the connection alive
   in a simple understandable form:

   Note: I performed this task on my local server, which is why I used the IP address 127.0.0.1. If you
   want to perform this task to share the files onto a different system, you must know the IP address of
   that system. The process will be the same - you only have to paste the IP address in place of
   127.0.0.1. Avoid using Ports like 8888, 8080 etc. Because many servers & services use this as Default
   Port number.

On Reciever System:
   Step 1: Before starting the port, create the file or folder that will store the received data coming
   from another computer. To do that, follow the below procedure and commands :
$> touch Recieved.txt

   Now, you can see the file is created by using this command, or else, you can create the file manually
   too.

   Step 2: On Computer , start netcat listening on a port with this command:

   Well, you can start the listening on any Port like 4444 , 4000, 1234, 8080.
$> nc -lv -p 4444 > Recieved.txt

   This opens port 4444 and saves any received data to received.txt, which means that any data that
   comes in will be going to Received.txt.

   Step 3: Determine Server IP (On the Receiving Machine):
   Find the Local IP Address:
$> ip addr show
   or
$> ifconfig

   Look for the local IP address associated with the network interface (e.g., enp0s3 for Ethernet or
   wlp2s0 for Wi-Fi).

On sender system:
   Step 4: Now create the file on the sender system that we want to send to the server repeating the
   first step and add some text for the demonstration as in the file below:
   Screenshot-2023-12-01-121532-(1)

   I added some data in the file.txt for the demonstration.

   Step 5: Choose the Server IP and Port Number:
   Use the IP address obtained from the step 3 (127.0.0.1) and the chosen port number (4444).

   Step 6: Send the file to the server.
   The file.txt is the file that we want to send to another computer. It will be directly saved in
   received.txt. Received.txt is the file that we used to open the port. Any data that the other
   computer sends will be stored in Received.txt.
$> nc -v 127.0.0.1 4444 < file.txt

   Here, 127.0.0.1 is the IP address that we obtained from the receiver system.

   Ip Address
   If your file did not get sent or any error occurred, you just need to give the path of the file that
   you want to send like this:
$> nc -v 127.0.0.1 4444 < '/home/sk/Desktop/file.txt'

   This connects to port 4444 on Computer 1 and sends file.zip through the connection.

   Step 7: Then, in the final step, you need to start the listening on Computer 1. Then, on Computer 2,
   you need to give the path of the file that you want to send and just hit enter.

   The final output will look like this on both of the computers:

   As you can see the file was successsfully received in our computer by the name of recieved.txt that
   we set in the first Command on the receiver's Computer & you can also see the data in the file.

   Step 8: When finished, press CTRL+C on either computer to close the connection.

Conclusion
   Netcat is a flexible networking device that may be used to effortlessly switch documents between
   computer structures on the identical time as additionally preserving the session chronic for in
   addition verbal exchange. By starting a listening netcat example on the receiving give up and
   connecting through a sender netcat way, a record may be fast sent over the community. At this factor,
   the open socket can be used to ship typed messages or distinct information via method of actually
   inputting it within the sending terminal. When completed communicating, urgent CTRL + C will
   terminate the session. In just a few clean steps, netcat lets in file transfers and persistent
   terminal-based definitely networking with each different device.

File Transfer

   There is no shortage of ways to transfer a file over a network. Most file transfers are ably handled
   by email, network file systems, HTTP, SFTP, or other protocols. What do you do, though, when that
   file is too big to email, the transfer is between two machines not connected to the Internet, or you
   just need to do one quick file transfer without having to set up and tear down a file server? In
   these and other situations Ncat can be the right tool for the job. Some tricky file transfer
   scenarios can really make you appreciate the flexibility of a raw network pipe.

   As you know, Ncat by default sends all its traffic without encryption, so it is possible for someone
   to intercept files in transit. See the section called "SSL" for one method of encrypting traffic.

   By default, Ncat doesn't close its connection until it is closed by the remote end, even after it has
   exhausted its input. That is because (as far as Ncat knows) the remote server may still have data to
   send back. The --send-only option, when applicable, changes this behavior to close the connection and
   quit at the end of input. This is normally what you want when doing a one-way file transfer.

   A basic file transfer is very simple: Start Ncat in listen mode on one end, start Ncat in connect
   mode on the other end, and pipe the file over the connection. There are two ways to do this that
   differ only in which end listens, the sender or the receiver. Sometimes you can't create a listening
   socket on one end of the transfer because of a lack or permissions, NAT, or filtering. As long as you
   can listen on at least one end, though, you can use this technique.

   These examples show how to transfer inputfile on host1 to outputfile on host2. Here no port number
   was specified so Ncat will use its default port of 31337. To use a different port just list it on the
   command line.

   Transfer a file, receiver listens
          host2$> ncat -l > outputfile
          host1$> ncat --send-only host2 < inputfile

   Transfer a file, sender listens
          host1$> ncat -l --send-only < inputfile
          host2$> ncat host1 > outputfile

   Note the order of the commands. The listener must be started first, regardless of the direction of
   transfer, or else the client will not have anything to connect to.

   The above technique works fine for sending a single file. One way to send multiple files is to bundle
   them up with tar or zip and send the archive file. But there's an even easier way. Just pipe the
   output of tar directly into Ncat on the sending side, and pipe Ncat's output into tar on the
   receiving side. This is especially useful when the sending computer doesn't have enough free disk
   space to hold the archive file. Here's how to transfer <files> using the "receiver listens" method,
   though of course the "sender listens" method works just as well.

   Transfer a bundle of files
          host2$> ncat -l | tar xzv
          host1$> tar czv <files> | ncat --send-only host2

   Not only tar files but any stream of bytes can be transferred in this way. Here is an example of
   transferring an entire disk image from host1 to host2. Naturally, the disk should be unmounted or
   mounted read-only.

   Transfer a disk image
          host2$> ncat -l > host1-hda.image
          host1$> ncat --send-only host2 < /dev/hda

   Disk images are typically large files that take a long time to transfer. You can compress the image
   on the fly while sending and decompress it on the other end. Whether this makes an improvement
   depends on the speed of the network and the compression program.

   Transfer a disk image with compression
          host2$> ncat -l | bzip2 -d > host1-hda.image
          host1$> cat /dev/hda | bzip2 | ncat --send-only host2

   The basic file transmission technique described at the beginning of this section fails if neither
   participating host is capable of listening, or the two hosts can't communicate directly. This
   situation has become common with the prevalence of network address translation. A way to work around
   it is to use a third host as an intermediary. The intermediate host listens in connection brokering
   mode and the other two hosts connect to it. Recall from the section called "Connection Brokering"
   that in connection brokering mode any input received on one socket is copied and sent out to all
   other sockets. With just two hosts connected this is especially simple: anything coming from one host
   gets forwarded to the other. This example shows host1 sending inputfile to outputfile on host2, using
   host3 as an intermediary.

   Transfer a file through an intermediary
          host3$> ncat -l --broker
          host2$> ncat host3 > outputfile
          host1$> ncat --send-only host3 < inputfile

   Note that it's important for host2 (the receiving host) to connect to the broker before host1 (the
   sending host) does. The broker does not buffer received data to send to hosts that connect later.
   After the file is transferred, it is necessary to forcibly disconnect the Ncat on host2 with ctrl+C.
   The broker never disconnects any of its clients.

How to Use Netcat to Transfer Files on Linux
October 21, 2021

   Lots of software can help to transfer files between multiple computers including FTP, NFS, Samba, and
   more. However, configuring those services incorrectly might make your server vulnerable to attacks.
   If this is a concern, you can use Netcat to transfer files between multiple devices securely.

   Netcat, also known as a "TCP/IP swiss army knife," is a command-line network tool that allows you to
   transfer files through local networks or the Internet. It provides an easier way to transfer data
   without the need for additional services.

   In this guide, we will show you how to use Netcat to transfer files on Linux.

Prerequisites
     * A Linux server
     * A root password configured on your server

   For the purposes of this tutorial, we will use the following setup:
     * Sender Host IP: 69.87.221.67
     * Receiver Host IP: 45.58.46.205

Step 1 - Install Netcat
   By default, Netcat is not available in Linux, so you will need to install it first.

   For Ubuntu and Debian based distributions, install Netcat using the following command:
$> apt-get install netcat-openbsd pv -y

   For CentOS and RHEL based distributions, install Netcat using the following command:
$> dnf install nmap-ncat pv -y

Step 2 - Transfer Files Between Two Linux Machine
   First, create a sample file.txt on the sender host.
$> echo "Transferring file using Netcat" > file.txt

   Next, you will need to run the nc command on the receiver host from where you want to receive the
   file.
$> nc -l -p 8585 > file.txt

   This command will instruct nc to listen for incoming requests on port 8585 until it receives a
   request. Once the request is received it will receive the file.txt file.

   Next, go to the sender host, run the following command to send the file.txt file to the receiver
   host:
$> nc -N 45.58.46.205 8585 < /root/file.txt

Step 3 - Transfer and Compress Files Between Two Linux Machine
   In this section, we will show you how to transfer and compress the larger file using Netcat.
   In this example, we will transfer the ubuntu.iso file from one machine to another.

   On the sender machine from where you want to transfer the ubuntu.iso file, run the following command:
$> tar -zcf - ubuntu.iso | pv | nc -l -p 8585 -q 25

   In the above command, tar is used to compress the file, and the pv command is used to monitor the
   progress of the file.

   Next, go to the receiver machine and run the following command to receive the ubuntu.iso file:
$> nc 69.87.221.67 8585 | pv | tar -zxf -

Conclusion
   Congratulations! You have successfully transferred files between two computers using the Netcat
   command. You can now use Netcat to transfer files over a secure network.

How to transfer files between servers using Netcat
Aug 26, 2020

   On linux/unix environments scp are rsyncare widely used to transfer/synchronize files between servers
   since they provide a secure way to transfer files between two or more computer nodes.

   Quickly:
me@server1 ~ $> nc -l -p 4444 < file.txt
me@server2 ~ $> nc -w 3 server1 4444 > file.txt

   Netcat for file transfer is extremely insecure and may only be used when security is not the concern
   And you have a big file. Otherwise, use scp or rsync.
   Quick difference between ssh copy or rsync and netcat

   If you really have to use netcat, here an example of how to do that:

   Install netcat:

   freebsd: pkg install netcat
   redhat/centos: yum install netcat
   ubuntu: apt install netcat
   archlinux: pacman -S netcat

   Scneario
   Considering you want to transfer a file from server_1 to server_2. Or better talking in netcat way:
   Getting a file on server_1 from server_2:

   Transfering
   From server_1, where the file "bigfile.txt" exist:
user@server1 ~ $> nc -l -p 4444 < bigfile.txt

   Arguments:
   -l, - listen: listen mode, for inbound connects
   -p, - local-port=NUM: local port number

   From server_2, who will get the file from server_1:
user@server2 ~ $> nc -w 3 server1 4444 > bigfile.txt

   Arguments:
   -w, - wait=SECS: timeout for connects and final net reads

   In case you want to see the progress, install pv (pipe viewer) and add to nc command:

   Please note that if netcat is installed and the nc command is not available, netcat is probably
   represented by ncat and/or netcat command.

   Some use-cases
     * You have an iso file in a dev server and would like to transfer it to another one and security is
       not a problem.
     * You have a big system library on one dev server and would like to transfer to another one and
       security is not a problem.
     * You don't want to bother the dev server ssh process and you just have a simple iso file to
       transfer and security is not a problem.

   Conclusion
   Again, netcat is insecure and is not to be used as file transfer. Use it only if you have to,
   otherwise use scp or rsync.

How do I receive files via netcat?

uxer
   In Linux, you can transfer files over the network using netcat.
   Example article:
   https://tutorials.technology/tutorials/How-to-transfer-files-over-the-network-using-Netcat.html
   Snippets from the article:

   Receiving side
$> nc -l -p 9999 > received_file.txt

   Sending side
$> nc 192.168.0.1 9999 < received_file.txt

   In OpenBSD however, I can send the file and receive it in Linux, but upon issuing the example command
   for receiving in OpenBSD, nc returns usage message. The man says that -l & -p cannot be used
   together.

   Questions:
     * Is it possible to receive files via OpenBSD's netcat? How?
     * nc doesn't exit and doesn't print any mesasage on successful transfer of your file but keeps
       running. Is there a way to add some human-friendliness in this regard?
     * Any alternative utilities/approaches that directly and easily transfer files over the network
       (and exit upon completion)?


$> nc -N -l 9999 > recv.txt

   and
$> nc -N localhost 9999 < file.txt
