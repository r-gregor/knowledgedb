nordvpn command [options] [arguments]
PARAMETERS
   login
       Authenticates your NordVPN account. Typically opens a browser window for authentication.

   connect []
       Establishes a VPN connection. You can specify a country (e.g., 'us'), city (e.g., 'new york'), or a
       specific server ID. Supports options like --group (e.g., 'double_vpn', 'p2p') and --protocol (e.g.,
       'nordlynx', 'openvpn_udp').

   disconnect
       Terminates the active VPN connection.

   status
       Displays the current VPN connection status, including the connected server, IP address, and protocol.

   settings
       Shows the current NordVPN application settings. Use nordvpn settings set to modify them.

   set
       Configures various NordVPN settings. Common options include killswitch on|off, autoconnect on|off, dns
       , protocol , cybersec on|off, and meshnet on|off.

   account
       Displays your NordVPN account information, including subscription status and expiration date.

   whitelist
       Manages the VPN Kill Switch whitelist. You can whitelist applications, IP subnets, or ports to bypass
       the VPN connection.

   refresh
       Refreshes the local server list cache to ensure you have the latest server information.

   enable
       Starts the NordVPN service daemon. This allows the client to establish VPN connections and manage
       network traffic.

   disable
       Stops the NordVPN service daemon. This prevents the client from establishing VPN connections.

   autoconnect [on|off]
       Configures whether NordVPN should automatically connect to a VPN server when the service starts or on
       system boot.

   update
       Checks for and installs updates for the NordVPN client application.

   version
       Displays the installed NordVPN client version.

   diagnose
       Gathers diagnostic information about the NordVPN client and system for troubleshooting purposes.

DESCRIPTION
   The 'nordvpn' command-line interface provides a robust and comprehensive way to manage your NordVPN
   connection directly from your Linux terminal. It allows users to connect to VPN servers, disconnect,
   view connection status, and configure advanced settings such as Kill Switch, auto-connect, DNS, and
   preferred protocols (NordLynx, OpenVPN). It's designed for seamless integration and automation,
   enabling users to maintain online privacy and security without a graphical user interface. The client
   manages network routing, DNS resolution, and firewall rules to ensure your traffic is protected
   efficiently and securely.

CAVEATS
   A valid NordVPN subscription is required for service usage.
   The 'nordvpn' daemon service must be running for commands to function; it's typically managed with
   'systemctl' (e.g., 'sudo systemctl start nordvpn.service').
   Kill Switch functionality relies on underlying firewall mechanisms (like iptables or nftables) and
   can block all internet traffic if the VPN connection drops or is not established.

SERVICE MANAGEMENT
   The 'nordvpn' client relies on a background service. You can manage this service using 'systemctl'.
   For example:
   sudo systemctl start nordvpn.service (start the daemon)
   sudo systemctl stop nordvpn.service (stop the daemon)
   sudo systemctl enable nordvpn.service (enable daemon to start on boot)
   sudo systemctl disable nordvpn.service (disable daemon from starting on boot)
   sudo systemctl status nordvpn.service (check daemon status)

THREAT PROTECTION LITE
   NordVPN offers a Threat Protection Lite feature that blocks malicious websites and ads at the DNS
   level. Enable it with nordvpn set threat-protection-lite on. Note that the full Threat Protection
   suite is typically available on desktop GUI applications and offers more extensive features.

MESHNET
   Meshnet is a NordVPN feature that allows you to create secure, private connections between your
   devices, enabling direct access to files and services as if they were on the same local network, even
   across different geographical locations. It can be toggled using nordvpn set meshnet on|off.

HISTORY
   NordVPN was founded in 2012. Its Linux command-line client has steadily evolved, becoming a primary
   interface for many Linux users to manage their VPN connections. Early versions primarily relied on
   the OpenVPN protocol. The introduction of NordLynx (NordVPN's WireGuard-based protocol) and features
   like Meshnet significantly enhanced performance, functionality, and user experience, making the CLI a
   powerful and feature-rich tool for privacy and security on Linux systems.
