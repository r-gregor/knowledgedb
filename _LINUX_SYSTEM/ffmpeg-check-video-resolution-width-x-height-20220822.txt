How to Check Video Resolution Width(W) and Height(H) in Linux
August 9, 2022

   When you check statistics, video consumption among users is increasing, which means video consumption
   is becoming part of daily life for people of all ages. So I thought, why not add a video of the
   performed steps, which will be very helpful for the reader to understand the steps?

   For that reason, I started recording the output of the terminal using the inbuilt GNOME 42 screen
   recording features, but the problem for me was that I was unaware of the screencast or video width
   and height, so I was intrigued to know the height and width of the video through a terminal.

   CLI users like me always charge up to perform all work through the terminal itself, and if you too
   are like me and want to find the width and height of video through the terminal, then this article
   will be more than enough to know.

Find Video Width and Height from Terminal
   It's quite simple to find the width and height of the video from the terminal, you just need to have
   a prerecorded video and the FFmpeg package installed on your system.

Install FFmpeg utility
   Most likely, you will find the FFmpeg libraries installed on your system because many applications
   like Chrome, OBS Studio, VLC, and others use the FFmpeg libraries like (libavcodec,
   libavutil, libavformat, libavfilter, libavdevice, libswscale, and libswresample) as dependencies to
   handle video and audio.

   On the other hand, you can use the command line utilities ffmpeg, ffplay, and ffprobe from this list.
   We will use the ffprobe command to find the resolution of the video, which you need to install by
   running the following command.

   Users of Ubuntu or Debian-based systems like Pop!_OS, Linux Mint, etc., need to run the below command
   to install FFmpeg.
$> sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
$> sudo apt install ffmpeg

   If you do have the latest version of a Red Hat-based OS like RockyLinux or AlmaLinux, then execute
   the following lines of command on your screen.

   For any reason, if you are not able to find FFmpeg, then read the official documentation.
$> sudo dnf install --nogpgcheck https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/\
	epel-release-latest-$(rpm -E %rhel).noarch.rpm
$> sudo dnf install --nogpgcheck https://mirrors.rpmfusion.org/free/el/\
	rpmfusion-free-release-$(rpm -E %rhel).noarch.rpm \
	https://mirrors.rpmfusion.org/nonfree/el/rpmfusion-nonfree-release-$(rpm -E %rhel).noarch.rpm
$> sudo dnf install ffmpeg

   Fedora-based users need to run the below command to install FFmpeg on your system.
$> sudo dnf makecache
$> sudo dnf install ffmpeg-free

   Users of Arch-based distributions like Garuda Linux and Manjaro Linux need to run the below
   command to install the FFmpeg package.
$> sudo pacman -Syu
$> sudo pacman -Sy ffmpeg

Find Video Resolution using the ffprobe command
   Once the installation is finished, you will use the ffprobe utility to discover the video resolution
   of the corresponding media, and you will also have multiple choices of format for how you want to
   print video resolution information on your screen.

   So first, get familiar with command syntax.
$> ffprobe -v error -show_entries stream=width,height -of default=noprint_wrappers=1 /path/of/video
     * -v error suppresses unwanted information except for any error.
     * -show_entries stream=width, height from the video metadata to extract width and height
       information.
     * -of as I said earlier, you can have output in various formats like default, XML, JSON, etc.
     * /path/of/video specify the path of the video where it is located.

Print video resolution with variable names
   To show you how to use the ffprobe command to find video resolution on your end, let me run the below
   command on my terminal screen, which will just print the size of the picture with a variable name for
   your easy understanding.
$> ffprobe -v error -show_entries stream=width,height -of default=noprint_wrappers=1 Videos/Screencasts/nala.webm

Print video resolution without variable names
   If you don't want to print variable names, then you can run the below command.
$> ffprobe -v error -select_streams v -show_entries stream=width,height -of csv=p=0:s=x /path/of/video

Print video resolution in JSON format
   As I said earlier, we can display the video resolution of a video in a couple of different ways, and
   one of them is to print video resolution information in JSON format, which can be helpful for
   programmers.

   To display the output in JSON format, execute the below code.
$> ffprobe -v error -select_streams v -show_entries stream=width,height -of json Videos/Screencasts/nala.webm

   That's all for now!
