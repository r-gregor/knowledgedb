Building a "Hello World" AppImage on Linux
27 March 2024

AppImage is a format for distributing portable software on Linux without needing superuser permissions to
install the application. It allows developers to package desktop applications in a way that they can run
on various Linux distributions. This tutorial demonstrates how to build a basic "Hello World" AppImage,
providing a straightforward example of how to bundle and distribute software in the Linux ecosystem.

This guide will take you through the steps of creating a simple "Hello World" AppImage. You'll
start from writing a basic C program, packaging it into an AppImage, and running it on your Linux system.

STEP 1
Install AppImage Tool and Dependencies: Download the AppImage tool and make it executable.
$> wget https://github.com/AppImage/appimagetool/releases/download/continuous/appimagetool-x86_64.AppImage
$> chmod +x appimagetool-x86_64.AppImage

    Additionally, install zsync which is needed for updating AppImages.
$> sudo apt-get install zsync

STEP 2
Create Directory Structure: Set up the directory structure that will house your application's files.
$> mkdir -p AppDir/usr/bin

STEP 3
Create Hello World Binary: Write your Hello World program in C, save it as hello-world.c, compile it, and
test the output.

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
	printf("Hello, LinuxConfig.org!\n");
return 0;
}

    Compile and run your program to ensure it works:
$> gcc hello-world.c -o hello-world
$> ./hello-world

    You should see the output: "Hello, LinuxConfig.org!"

STEP 4
Copy Binary to AppDir: Move the compiled binary to the directory structure you created earlier.
$> cp hello-world AppDir/usr/bin/

STEP 5
Create Desktop Entry: Write a .desktop file to specify how your application should be integrated into desktop menus.

[Desktop Entry]
Type=Application
Name=Hello World
Exec=hello-world
Icon=hello-world
Categories=Utility;

Save this content as AppDir/hello-world.desktop.

STEP 6
Create or Upload a Custom Icon: Generate a simple icon for your application using ImageMagick. This step
involves creating an image that will serve as the icon for your AppImage. Use the following command to
create a basic "Hello World" icon and save it within the AppDir structure, ensuring it's properly recognized
by desktop environments when your AppImage is executed.
$> convert -size 256x256 xc:white -gravity center -pointsize 24 -fill black -annotate +0+0 "Hello World" \
   AppDir/hello-world.png

After executing the command, ensure the icon file hello-world.png is saved to AppDir/. This location is
commonly used for application icons and will help ensure your AppImage is integrated smoothly with desktop
environments.

STEP 7
Create AppRun: This script acts as the entry point for your AppImage. Write the following script
and make it executable.

#!/bin/bash
exec $APPDIR/usr/bin/hello-world

Save this script as AppDir/AppRun and make it executable:
$> chmod +x AppDir/AppRun

STEP 8
Compile/Create the AppImage: This step involves using the appimagetool to package your application into an
AppImage. The command below specifies the architecture of the target system where the AppImage will run. In
this example, we use ARCH=x86_64 to denote a 64-bit system. This environment variable helps the tool
understand the architecture for which it needs to package the AppImage. It's crucial for ensuring
compatibility with the target system.
$> ARCH=x86_64 ./appimagetool-x86_64.AppImage AppDir HelloWorld.AppImage

The ARCH environment variable can be set to different values depending on the target architecture of your
application. For instance, if you are targeting an ARM-based system, you might use ARCH=armhf or ARCH=aarch64
for 32-bit and 64-bit ARM architectures, respectively. Adjusting this variable allows the AppImage to be
created specifically for the architecture of the device it will run on, ensuring optimal performance and
compatibility. Make sure to download and use the version of appimagetool that matches the architecture
you're compiling for. This step finalizes the packaging process, producing an executable AppImage named
HelloWorld.AppImage that is ready to be distributed and run on compatible Linux systems.

STEP 9
Test Your AppImage:
Finally, execute your newly created AppImage to see the "Hello World" message.
$> ./HelloWorld.AppImage

If everything was done correctly, you should see "Hello, LinuxConfig.org!" printed in your terminal,
indicating that your AppImage is running successfully.

Conclusion
Through this tutorial, you've learned the basics of creating an AppImage by packaging a simple "Hello
World" application. This process involves compiling your application, setting up a directory structure,
creating necessary metadata files like the desktop entry and AppRun script, and finally, using the
appimagetool to bundle everything into a single, portable AppImage file.

AppImages are a powerful way to distribute Linux applications, as they can run on virtually any Linux
distribution without the need for installation or root access. By following the steps outlined in this
guide, you can package your own applications as AppImages, making them easily sharable and usable across
different systems. Whether you're developing a simple utility or a complex application, AppImages
provide a convenient and user-friendly distribution method.

As you become more familiar with the AppImage format, you may explore more advanced features, such
as integrating update capabilities, customizing application icons, and optimizing your AppImage for
different Linux environments. The simplicity and portability of AppImages make them an excellent choice
for developers looking to reach a broader Linux audience.
