What is the most supported MIME type in Debian in 2025?
18th January 2025

   Seven and twelve years ago, I measured what the most supported MIME type in Debian was, first by analysing
   the desktop files in all packages in the archive, then by analysing the DEP-11 AppStream data set. I guess
   it is time to repeat the measurement, only for unstable as last time:

   Debian Unstable:
  count MIME type
  ----- -----------------------
     63 image/png
     63 image/jpeg
     57 image/tiff
     54 image/gif
     51 image/bmp
     50 audio/mpeg
     48 text/plain
     42 audio/x-mp3
     40 application/ogg
     39 audio/x-wav
     39 audio/x-flac
     36 audio/x-vorbis+ogg
     35 audio/x-mpeg
     34 audio/x-mpegurl
     34 audio/ogg
     33 application/x-ogg
     32 audio/mp4
     31 audio/x-scpls
     31 application/pdf
     29 audio/x-ms-wma

   The list was created like this using a sid chroot:

$> cat /var/lib/apt/lists/*sid*_dep11_Components-amd64.yml.gz | \
   zcat | awk '/^  - \S+\/\S+$/ {print $2 }' | sort | \
   uniq -c | sort -nr | head -20

   It is nice to see that the same number of packages now support PNG and JPEG. Last time JPEG had more
   support than PNG. Most of the MIME types are known to me, but the 'audio/x-scpls' one I have no idea
   what represent, except it being an audio format. To find the packages claiming support for this
   format, the appstreamcli command from the appstream package can be used:

$> appstreamcli what-provides mediatype audio/x-scpls | grep Package: | sort -u
Package: alsaplayer-common
Package: amarok
Package: audacious
Package: brasero
Package: celluloid
Package: clapper
Package: clementine
Package: cynthiune.app
Package: elisa
Package: gtranscribe
Package: kaffeine
Package: kmplayer
Package: kylin-burner
Package: lollypop
Package: mediaconch-gui
Package: mediainfo-gui
Package: mplayer-gui
Package: mpv
Package: mystiq
Package: parlatype
Package: parole
Package: pragha
Package: qmmp
Package: rhythmbox
Package: sayonara
Package: shotcut
Package: smplayer
Package: soundconverter
Package: strawberry
Package: syncplay
Package: vlc
$>

   Look like several video and auto tools understand the format. Similarly one can check out the number
   of packages supporting the STL format commonly used for 3D printing:

$> appstreamcli what-provides mediatype model/stl | grep Package: | sort -u
Package: cura
Package: freecad
Package: open3d-viewer
$>

   How strange the slic3r and prusa-slicer packages do not support STL. Perhaps just missing
   package metadata? Luckily the amount of package metadata in Debian is getting better, and hopefully
   this way of locating relevant packages for any file format will be the preferred one soon.
