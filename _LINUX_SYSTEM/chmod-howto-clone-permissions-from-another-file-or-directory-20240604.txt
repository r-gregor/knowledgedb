How to Clone Permissions from Another File or Directory on Linux
30 May 2024

In this article, we will explore how to clone permissions from one file or directory to another on a
Linux system. This is a common task that can save time and ensure consistency across your file system. By
using a few simple commands, you can easily duplicate the permissions of any file or directory to another,
maintaining the desired access control settings.

Example Methods for Replicating Permissions
In Linux, every file and directory has a set of permissions that determine who can read, write, or
execute the file. These permissions are crucial for maintaining the security and integrity of the file
system. Sometimes, you may need to replicate the permissions from one file or directory to another to
ensure consistency or to apply a standard set of permissions across multiple files and directories. This
can be efficiently done using the 'chmod' and 'stat' commands.

    Viewing Current Permissions: Before cloning permissions, it's important to view the current
    permissions of the source file or directory. This can be done using the 'stat' command.
$> stat source_file

    This command provides detailed information about the file, including its permissions in both symbolic
    and numeric forms. For example, the output might include:

    File: source_file
    Size: 1234                Blocks: 8           IO Block: 4096    regular file
    Device: 801h/2049d        Inode: 12345678     Links: 1
    Access: (0644/-rw-r--r--)  Uid: ( 1000/ user)   Gid: ( 1000/ user)

    The 'Access' line shows the current permissions. In this example, the file has read and write
    permissions for the owner, and read-only permissions for the group and others.
    Cloning Permissions Using chmod: Once you have viewed the permissions of the source file, you can
    clone these permissions to another file using the 'chmod' command.
$> chmod --reference=source_file target_file

    This command sets the permissions of target_file to match those of source_file. For example, if
    source_file has permissions 0644, then target_file will be updated to have the same permissions. This
    is particularly useful when you need to ensure that multiple files have the same access settings.
    Cloning Permissions for a Directory: The process for cloning permissions for a directory is similar
    to that for a file. You can use the chmod command with the --reference option to clone the permissions
    of a source directory to a target directory.
$> chmod --reference=source_directory target_directory

    This command ensures that the target directory has the same permissions as the source directory. This
    is useful when you need to replicate directory structures with identical permissions.
    Recursively Cloning Permissions: If you need to clone permissions for all files and subdirectories
    within a directory, you can use the -R (recursive) option with the chmod command.
$> chmod -R --reference=source_directory target_directory

    This command applies the permissions of source_directory to target_directory and all of its
    contents. This is particularly helpful when duplicating entire directory trees with specific
    permission settings.

    Cloning Permissions Using getfacl and setfacl: The getfacl and setfacl commands are used to get and
    set file access control lists (ACLs), which provide a more detailed and flexible permission mechanism.
$> getfacl -p source_file | setfacl --set-file=- target_file

    Here, getfacl -p source_file retrieves the ACLs of source_file. The output is then piped to setfacl
    --set-file=- target_file, which applies these ACLs to target_file. This method is especially useful
    for complex permission setups.

    Verifying Cloned Permissions: After cloning permissions, it is important to verify that the target
    file or directory has the correct permissions. You can use the stat command to check the permissions.
$> stat target_file

    or
$> stat target_directory

    By comparing the output to that of the source file or directory, you can confirm that the permissions
    have been successfully cloned.

Conclusion
Cloning permissions from one file or directory to another in Linux is a straightforward process that
can save time and ensure consistency across your file system. By using the 'stat' and 'chmod' commands,
you can easily view and replicate permissions, maintaining the desired access control settings. This
tutorial has covered the steps needed to clone permissions effectively, providing you with the knowledge
to manage file permissions in a Linux environment efficiently.
