How to: Mount an ISO image under Linux

   by [12]nixCraft on March 29, 2004 · [13]61 comments· LAST UPDATED December 11, 2008

   An ISO image is an archive file (disk image) of an optical disc using a conventional ISO
   (International Organization for Standardization) format. ISO image files typically have a
   file extension of .ISO. The name "ISO" is taken from the ISO 9660 file system used with
   CD-ROM media, but an ISO image can also contain UDF file system because UDF is
   backward-compatible to ISO 9660.

   You can mount an ISO images via the loop device under Linux. It is possible to specify
   transfer functions (for encryption/decryption or other purposes) using loop device.

   But, how do you mount an ISO image under Linux? You need to use mount command as follows:

Procedure to mount ISO images under Linux

   1) You must login as a root user, if not root user then switch to root user using following
   command:
   $ su -

   2) Create the directory i.e. mount point:
   # mkdir -p /mnt/disk

   3) Use mount command as follows to mount iso file called disk1.iso:
   # mount -o loop disk1.iso /mnt/disk

   4) Change directory to list files stored inside an ISO image:
   # cd /mnt/disk
   # ls -l

More about loop device

   A loop device is a pseudo-device that makes a file accessible as a block device. Loop
   devices are often used for CD ISO images and floppy disc images. Mounting a file containing
   a filesystem via such a loop mount makes the files within that filesystem accessible. They
   appear in the mount point directory using above commands.

How to Mount and Unmount an ISO Image in RHEL/CentOS/Fedora and Ubuntu

   An ISO image or .iso (International Organization for Standardization) file is an archive
   file that contains a disk image called ISO 9660 file system format. Every ISO file have
   .ISO extension has defined format name taken from the ISO 9660 file system and specially
   used with CD/DVD Rom’s. In simple words an iso file is a disk image.

   mount and unmount iso images in linux

   I have seen most of the Linux operating system that we download from the internet are .ISO
   format. Typically an ISO image contains installation of software’s such as, operating
   system installation, games installation or any other applications. Sometimes it happens
   that we need to access files and view content from these ISO images, but without wasting
   disk space and time in burning them on to CD/DVD.

   This article describes how to mount and unmount an ISO image on a Linux Operating system to
   access and list the content of files.

How to Mount an ISO Image

   To mounting an ISO image on Linux (RedHat, CentOS, Fedora or Ubuntu), you must be logged in
   as “root” user or switch to “sudo” and run the following commands from a terminal to create
   a mount point.
# mkdir /mnt/iso

OR

$ sudo mkdir /mnt/iso

   Once you created mount point, use the “mount” command to mount an iso file called
   “Fedora-18-i386-DVD.iso“.
# mount -t iso9660 -o loop /home/tecmint/Fedora-18-i386-DVD.iso /mnt/iso/

OR

$ sudo mount -t iso9660 -o loop /home/tecmint/Fedora-18-i386-DVD.iso /mnt/iso/

   After the ISO image mounted successfully, go the mounted directory at /mnt/iso and list the
   content of an ISO image. It will only mount in read-only mode, so none of the files can be
   modified.
# cd /mnt/iso
# ls -l

   You will see the list of files of an ISO image, that we have mounted in the above command.
   For example, the directory listing of an Fedora-18-i386-DVD.iso image would look like this.
total 16
drwxrwsr-x  3 root 101737 2048 Jan 10 01:00 images
drwxrwsr-x  2 root 101737 2048 Jan 10 01:00 isolinux
drwxrwsr-x  2 root 101737 2048 Jan 10 01:00 LiveOS
drwxrwsr-x 28 root 101737 4096 Jan 10 00:38 Packages
drwxrwsr-x  2 root 101737 4096 Jan 10 00:43 repodata
-r--r--r--  1 root root   1538 Jan 10 01:00 TRANS.TBL

How to Unmount an ISO Image

   Simply run the following command from the terminal either “root” or “sudo” to unmount an
   mounted ISO image.
# umount /mnt/iso

OR

$ sudo umount /mnt/iso

Where Options

    1. -t : This argument is used to indicate the given filesystem type.
    2. ISO 9660 : It describes standard and default filesystem structure to be used on CD/DVD
       ROMs.
    3. -o : Options are necessary with a -o argument followed by a separated comma string of
       options.
    4. loop: The loop device is a pseudo-device that often used for mounting CD/DVD ISO image
       and makes those files accessible as a block device.

Mount an ISO Image in Linux

   This page will explain how you can use ISO image files in Linux.

Contents

     * [29]1 Prerequisite Module
     * [30]2 Mount a CD ISO Image
     * [31]3 Mount a DVD ISO Image
     * [32]4 Mount an ISO Image in Gnome
     * [33]5 Open an ISO Image Without Mounting

Prerequisite Module

   You’ll have to make sure that the loop module is loaded before you can use this feature.
sudo modprobe loop

Mount a CD ISO Image

   We’ll use the regular mount command to mount the ISO image into a folder, just like you
   would do with a regular drive. The difference is that we pass the -o loop command to
   specify the loop module, which can handle ISO images.
sudo mount filename.iso /media/iso -t iso9660 -o loop

   Of course you should make sure that you have created the /media/iso folder ahead of time.

Mount a DVD ISO Image

   When mounting ISO images of DVDs, you might have to use the UDF type instead of ISO.
sudo mount filename.iso /media/iso -t udf -o loop

  [HOW TO] Mount ISO Image Without Burning Them
     ______________________________________________________________________________________

   For various reasons,you may want to use ISO images without burning them,and you just need
   to mount them in a easy way.
   First,create a directory which you want to mount ISO images to by running following command
   in terminal:

     sudo mkdir /media/ISOimage

   Then,add the loop module to your kernel,so it is possible to mount a compressed filesystem
   file:

     sudo modprobe loop

   Change directory where ISO images located:

     cd /iso-images-directory

   Now,use following command to mount ISO image:

     sudo mount iso-image-name.iso /media/ISOimage/ -t iso9660 -o loop

   replace “iso-image-name.iso”to your ISO image.
   And,use this command to umount ISO image:

     sudo umount /media/ISOimage
