How to Check SSD/HDD Health on Linux

   If you are a system administrator and responsible for managing Linux systems in Datacenter. Then, it
   is recommended that the health of the SSD and HDD drives be checked regularly. It will help you
   identify failed drives that can be replaced before any data loss occurs. To check SSD or HDD health
   in Linux, you can use tools like smartctl (part of the smartmontools package) and gnome-disks.
   smartctl provides detailed information and diagnostics for storage devices, including error rates,
   temperature, and overall health status. You can install it using your package manager.

Prerequisites
     * A server or Desktop running Linux operating system.
     * A root password is configured on the server.

Install Smartctl
   Smartctl is included in the default repository of all major Linux distributions. The following
   commands are run as root user. if you are not logged in as root, repent "sudo " to the commands.

   For Debian and Ubuntu distributions, install Smartctl using the following command:
$> apt install smartmontools -y

   For RHEL, CentOS, and Fedora distribution, install Smartctl using the following command:
$> dnf install smartmontools

   After installing Smartctl, start the Smartctl service using the following command:
$> systemctl start smartd

   You can check the status of the smartd with the following command:
$> systemctl status smartd

   You should get the following output:

Test Health of SSD/HDD
   After installing Smartctl, you will need to turn on SMART features on your hard drive.

   You can do it using the following command:
$> smartctl -s on /dev/sda

   The first thing you will need to do is to obtain information on SSD or HDD.

   You can done it using the following command:
$> smartctl -i /dev/sda

   This will give you detailed information about your hard drive.

Conclusion
   In the above guide, you learned how to install and use the S.M.A.R.T tool to check the health of your
   SSH and HDD drives. I hope this will help you a lot. For more information, read the smartctl man
   page.
