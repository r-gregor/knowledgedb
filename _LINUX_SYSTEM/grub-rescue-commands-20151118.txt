grub rescue> commands are unix ?
Well maybe the forum category needed to be outside the individual distributions as I am stuck in grub . . . mods please move if need be . . .

Are the commands for
Code:

grub rescue>

(a prompt you really don't want to see, btw) after an install of Ubuntu Karmic 9.10
are they unix based . . . ?

I need to point the boot from this command prompt I get . . .
to the (hd0,1)/boot/grub/menu.lst but I think the (hd0,1)/boot/grub/device.map was corrupted by grub2 or otherwise installed wrong.

So first question is grub rescue> uses unix commands ?

Thank you very much if you happen to know anything about this grub rescue> command - not alot yet from google searches.

It's not unix although in its more normalized mode it supports a few shell commands, you can attempt to tell grub what hard drive to look at and what files to load (kernel for example.)

Type 'help' to get a listing of the commands and generally try searching the individual commands on google instead of a more general search.

Review the /boot/menu.cfg (nee grub.cfg/conf) and ensure everything looks acceptable there.

Thanks for the interest . . .
Code:

grub rescue>

is some kind of a different monster - immediately pops up . . .
no booting going on behind some "quiet" splash progress bar screen.

Something got mapped wrong with grub2 . . . maybe an easy fix with the right command.
I had tried to install Xubuntu 9.10 which uses grub 2 - and am now trying to just get back Ubuntu 9.04 (with legacy grub 0.97)
I of course tried entering help to list commands and get . . .

Code:

grub rescue> help
Unknown command 'help'
grub rescue>

I can use ls . . . making me think unix from my FreeBSD use.

Code:

grub rescue> ls
(hd0) (hd0,5) (hd0,1) (hd1) (hd1,5) (hd1,4) (hd1,3) (hd1,1)
grub rescue>
grub rescue> ls (hd0,1)/boot
./ ../ System.map-2.6.28-11-generic abi-2.6.28-11-generic confi
g-2.6.28-11-generic memtest+.bin vmcoreinfo-2.6.28-11-generic 
vmlinuz-2.6.28-11-generic grub/ initrd.img-2.6.28-11-generic
grub rescue>

and going into grub/ directory . . .
Code:

grub rescue> ls (hd0,1)/boot/grub
./ ../ device.map stage1 stage2 e2fs_stage1_5 fat_stage1_5 jfs_
stage1_5 minix_s
tage1_5 reiserfs_stage1_5 xfs_stage1_5 default installed-versio
n menu.lst
grub rescue>

How can I tell grub rescue> how to load the correct file
/module . . . insmod ?
http://linux.about.com/od/commands/l/blcmdl8_insmod.htm

Thank you very much for any suggestions or criticism.

I have the same problem,
some days ago my linux Netbook Remix 9.10 crashed and I turned the computer off keeping pushed the start button.
Since then when I try to boot the system appears:

Code:

GRUB loading.
error: biosdisk read error
grub rescue>

if I type the ls command it returns:

Code:

grub rescue> ls
(hd0) (hd0,5) (hd0,1) (hd1) (hd1,1)

end if I try to read the (hd0,1) it returns:

Code:

grub rescue> ls (hd0,1)/
error: biosdisk read error

any idea?
Thanks
