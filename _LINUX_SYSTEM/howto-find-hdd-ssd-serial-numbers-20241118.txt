How to find hard disk (SSD) serial numbers in Linux
November 17, 2024

You need to use the smartctl command to display the hard disk (SSD) serial numbers in Linux. This is useful
when changing your hard disk if it goes bad.

How do we find the serial number for hard disks and SSDs in Linux?

1. Open the terminal application.
2. Type the sudo smartctl -a /dev/DEVICE | grep -i serial to list serial number.
3 .Replace the /dev/DEVICE with actual Linux hard disk names such as /dev/sda, or /dev/hdd, or /dev/nvme0n1.

Using bash for loop to find multiple serial numbers in a single go
Prerequisite By default, smartctl command may not be installed on your system. Hence, use the apk command on
Alpine Linux, dnf command/yum command on RHEL & co, apt command/apt-get command on Debian, Ubuntu & co, zypper
command on SUSE/OpenSUSE, pacman command on Arch Linux to install the smartctl.

Say you have two or five hard disks in the server named/dev/sda, /dev/sdb, and so on. Here is how to list
them. Type the command at shell prompt:
$> for d in /dev/sd{a,b} do sudo smartctl -a "$d" | echo "$d: $(grep -i serial)" done

OR
$> for d in /dev/sd{a,b,c,d,e}; do smartctl -a "$d" | echo "$d: $(grep -i serial)"; done

The will show it as follows on your screen:
/dev/sda: Serial Number: 20096xyzzzzz /dev/sdb: Serial Number: 1829xyzzzzzy

Getting automated email notifications with smartd when the hard disk is about to fail
Smartd is the SMART Disk Monitoring Daemon for Linux and Unix-like system. SMART stands for Self-Monitoring,
Analysis, and Reporting Technology, a system built into many ATA-3 and later ATA, IDE, SSD, and SCSI-3 hard
drives. The main purpose of SMART is to monitor the reliability of hard drives, predict potential failures,
and perform various self-tests on the drives. Once smartd is configured, it can send you an email as follows:

This message was generated by the smartd daemon running on:
	host name: debian-www42

The following warning/error was logged by the smartd daemon:
Device: /dev/sda [SAT], 1 Currently unreadable (pending) sectors

Device info:
CT1000MX500SSD1, S/N:1829E1XYZZZZ, WWN:5-00a075-1e14a31df, FW:M3CR022, 1.00 TB

For details see host's SYSLOG.

You can also use the smartctl utility for further investigation.

The following lines provide the device names along with their serial numbers that need to be replaced as soon
as possible to avoid data loss. This is why Linux developers and system administrators need to know how to
find the serial numbers for their hard disks, including SSDs, on Linux.

Device: /dev/sda [SAT], 1 Currently unreadable (pending) sectors

Device info:
CT1000MX500SSD1, S/N:1829E1XYZZZZ, WWN:5-00a075-1e14a31df, FW:M3CR022, 1.00 TB

Please note that the smartctl command works with BSD family of operating systems including Unix-like systems.
Regardless of smartctl, it would help if you kept verified backups of all imprata data. Even though the tool
is great, it can not be predicted all the time, and sometimes SSDs or HDDs simply die on the spot. Therefore,
backup is the only way to avoid total data loss.

Using the lsblk command to list SERIAL numbers
The syntax is:
$> lsblk -o NAME,SERIAL /dev/DEVICE
$> lsblk -o NAME,SERIAL /dev/sda
$> lsblk -o NAME,SERIAL /dev/nvme0n1

Outputs:
NAME                        SERIAL
nvme0n1                     S4EMNFXYZEEETE
+-nvme0n1p1
+-nvme0n1p2
+-nvme0n1p3
	+-nvme0n1p3_crypt
	+-vgubuntu-root
	+-vgubuntu-swap_1

The -o or --output show a customized summary using a comma-separated list of columns such as NAME, SERIAL,
MODEL, TRAN, TYPE, SIZE, FSTYPE, MOUNTPOINT. For example, here is how to check /dev/nvme0n1 (PCIe SSD):

$> lsblk --output NAME,SERIAL,MODEL,TRAN,TYPE,SIZE,FSTYPE,MOUNTPOINT /dev/nvme0n1
