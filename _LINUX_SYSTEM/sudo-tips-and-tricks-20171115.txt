5 tricks for using the sudo command

Some helpful hints for using sudo — the command that allows admins to administer user system privileges

   The sudoers file can provide detailed control over user privileges, but with very little effort, you
   can still get a lot of benefit from sudo. In this post, we're going to look at some simple ways to
   get a lot of value out of the sudo command in Linux.

Trick 1: Nearly effortless sudo usage
   The default file on most Linux distributions makes it very simple to give select users the ability to
   run commands as root. In fact, you don’t even have to edit the /etc/sudoers file in any way to get
   started. Instead, you just add the users to the sudo or admin group on the system and you’re done.

   Adding users to the sudo or admin group in the /etc/group file gives them permission to run commands
   using sudo.
$ grep sudo /etc/group
sudo:x:27:shs,jdoe,peanut

   Assuming the standard /etc/sudoers setup, they should immediately be able to start using sudo
   commands once this change has been made. The privileges are derived through a line like this in the
   /etc/sudoers file:
%sudo   ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL

   The $sudo (or %admin) part of this line is a reference to the sudo (or admin) group. The rest of the
   line allows members of this group to run any command as any user. This much is built in. If you don’t
   want anyone to have this ability, don’t put anyone in the sudo (or admin) group on your system and
   this privilege level will not be implemented.
$ sudo whoami
[sudo] password for shs:
root

Trick 2: Running commands as other users — not just root
   While most people use sudo access to run commands as root, it also allows you to run commands as
   other users. Just use the -u option with the sudo command and specify the username.
$ sudo -u jdoe whoami
[sudo] password for shs:
jdoe

Trick 3: Changing the default editor for the visudo command

   The /etc/sudoers file should always be modified using the visudo command because this command helps
   to keep you from causing configuration errors that might make the resultant file unusable (i.e., it
   can break sudo). If the editor used by default is one that you’re not comfortable using, you can
   change it with this command:
sudo update-alternatives --config editor

   This command will display a list of editors with the current one marked with an asterisk and allows
   you to select the one that you prefer.
$ sudo update-alternatives --config editor
[sudo] password for shs:
There are 3 choices for the alternative editor (providing /usr/bin/editor).

  Selection    Path               Priority   Status
------------------------------------------------------------
* 0            /bin/nano           40        auto mode
  1            /bin/ed            -100       manual mode
  2            /bin/nano           40        manual mode
  3            /usr/bin/vim.tiny   10        manual mode

Press <enter> to keep the current choice[*], or type selection number:

Trick 4: Switching to root
   There are times when prefacing every command with "sudo" gets in the way of getting your work done.
   With a default /etc/sudoers configuration and membership in the sudo (or admin) group, you can assume
   root control using the command sudo su -. Extra care should always be taken when using the root
   account in this way.
$ sudo su -
[sudo] password for jdoe:
root@stinkbug:~#

Trick 5: Fixing a corrupt /etc/sudoers file
   A corrupt /etc/sudoers file can keep sudo from working and really mess up your day. Fortunately,
   there are some ways around this that don't involve a lot of work, and the visudo command provides
   some details on the problems needing to be fixed.

The problem
shs@stinkbug:/etc$ sudo date
>>> /etc/sudoers: syntax error near line 3 <<<
sudo: parse error in /etc/sudoers near line 3
sudo: no valid sudoers sources found, quitting
sudo: unable to initialize policy plugin

The fix
shs@stinkbug:/etc$ pkexec visudo
>>> /etc/sudoers: syntax error near line 3 <<<

More complex sudo options

   In future posts, we'll look at how sudo can be used to provide more fine-grained options for
   controlling sudo privileges.
