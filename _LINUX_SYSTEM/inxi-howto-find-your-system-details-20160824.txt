   There are lot of tools and applications available to display or find the Linux system details. Today,
   we will be discussing how to find your Linux desktop or server details using a simple and yet useful
   tool called “inxi”. It is free, open source, and full featured command line system system information
   tool. It shows system hardware, CPU, drivers, Xorg, Desktop, Kernel, GCC version(s), Processes, RAM
   usage, and a wide variety of other useful information. Be it a hard disk or CPU, mother board or the
   complete detail of the entire system, inxi will display it more accurately in seconds. Since it is
   CLI tool, you can use it in Desktop or server edition. Inxi is available in the default repositories
   of most Linux distributions and some BSD systems.

Install inxi
   Like I said, inxi tool is available in most Linux distribution repositories.

   On Arch Linux and derivatives:

   To install inxi in Arch Linux or its derivatives like Antergos, and Manajaro Linux, run:
sudo pacman -S inxi

   On Debian / Ubuntu and derivatives:
sudo apt-get install inxi

   On Fedora / RHEL / CentOS / Scientific Linux:
   inxi is available in the Fedora default repositories. So, just run the following command to install
   it straight away.
sudo dnf install inxi

   In RHEL and its clones like CentOS and Scientific Linux, you need to add the EPEL repository and then
   install inxi.

   To install EPEL repository, just run:
sudo dnf install epel-release

   Or,
sudo yum install epel-release

   After installing EPEL repository, install inxi using command:
sudo dnf install inxi

   Or,
sudo dnf install inxi

   On SUSE/openSUSE:
sudo zypper install inxi

How to use inxi?
   inxi will require some additional programs to operate properly. They will be installed along with
   inxi. However, in case if they are not installed automatically, you need to find and install them.

   To list all required programs, run:
inxi --recommends
   If you see any missing programs, then install them before start using inxi.
