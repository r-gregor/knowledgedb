Ubuntu: Download flash videos using the latest version of get-flash-videos

   Somehow the version of get_flash_videos (1.24) in Ubuntu Trusty and git repositories don't work with
   YouTube. The latest version (1.25) works and I followed the following steps to successfully download,
   install and use it for YouTube videos. I am documenting it here for my future reference as well as it
   may help someone looking for the solution. I know I used the Debian Sid version but it works with
   Ubuntu.
   (1) Step 1: Get the latest version of Get-flash-videos from Debian Sid repositories
   ([8]https://packages.debian.org/sid/all/get-flash-videos/download). You can download from any mirror
   as it is a pretty small file (in KBs).
   (2) Step 2: Use Ubuntu Software Center or gdebi to install it satisfying all dependencies. You may
   have to install perl packages beforehand by running the following command in the terminal:
   sudo apt-get install libwww-mechanize-perl libxml-simple-perl
   (3) Step 3: Check get-flash-videos version from the terminal by running the command:
   get_flash_videos --version
   Ensure that it is 1.25.
   (4) Now start downloading flash videos from websites like YouTube, DailyMotion, etc. It supports
   majority of the sites I know of and use. You can download videos from the terminal by running the
   command:
   get_flash_videos http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=<video id>
   or by giving the URL of the video site.
   Hope it helps.
