How to Show Seconds on the Clock Panel on Ubuntu 22.04 | 20.04 | 18.04

   We already know that Ubuntu 22.04 is a very customizable system. So much that sometimes you are
   surprised by the number of things you can do to it. Today I will show you how to Show Seconds on the
   Clock Panel.

   As we all know, GNOME is the default desktop environment of Ubuntu 22.04, and it is thanks to it
   that you will be able to see the interface that this great system has.

   By default, Ubuntu displays the clock on the top panel of the screen in the form of 24H; however,
   this does not include the seconds that go. Although it may seem a minor detail, it is possible that
   many users need it for some reason or another.

   The procedure is simple, let's go for it.

How to Show Seconds on the Clock Panel on Ubuntu 22.04 | 20.04 | 18.04
   To make this post, we have two different methods. One through the terminal and one through a tool
   called dconf-editor Either works and you can choose one or the other.

   In the case of the terminal, the process is simple and not complex.

   First, open one from the main menu or by running CTRL + ALT + T.

   As soon as it opens, as I always say, it is advisable to update the whole system.
$> sudo apt update
$> sudo apt upgrade

   Now just run this command:
$> gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface clock-show-seconds true

   If you want to revert the change, then simply run
$> gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface clock-show-seconds false

   The change will be immediate anyway.

Using donf-editor to Show Seconds on the Clock Panel on Ubuntu
   If you prefer not to use the terminal, you can also use a tool called dconf-editor that allows you to
   edit desktop and Ubuntu options from a convenient graphical interface.

   First you have to install it
$> sudo apt install dconf-editor

   Then, you can run it from the main menu.

   The tool is easy to use, and you just need to click on each category to find the appropriate option.

   In this case, follow the path org > gnome > desktop > interface until you see the Clock_show_seconds
   option.

   Just enable or disable it as you like.

Conclusion
   Ubuntu is a customizable system and one of the most used ones out there, so it's always good to know
   more about it. Tips like this can help newbies fall more and more in love with the system.
