How to get motherboard info on Ubuntu / Debian / CentOS / Linux
December 7, 2023

Get Motherboard Info on Linux
   To get details about the motherboard on your desktop pc or laptop, there are a couple of commands
   available on Linux. These commands will show the motherboard vendor, model name / part number and
   some other details like what bios/uefi firmware is installed on it.

   In this article we shall take look at some of the common hardware related commands that can be used
   to get information about motherboard on linux. These commands are available for all major linux
   distributions so they should work on Ubunt, Debian, CentOS, Fedora, OpenSUSE or any other linux
   distro that you are using.

   Now lets take a look at the commands one by one:

1. dmidecode
   The dmidecode command with the -t baseboard option will show details about the motherboard. Note that
   this command will output a lot of additional information that might not be related to the motherboard
   directly.

   On my main ubuntu pc, this is what I get
$> sudo dmidecode -t baseboard
# dmidecode 3.5
Getting SMBIOS data from sysfs.
SMBIOS 3.0.0 present.

Handle 0x0002, DMI type 2, 15 bytes
Base Board Information
        Manufacturer: Gigabyte Technology Co., Ltd.
        Product Name: H110M-H-CF
        Version: x.x
        Serial Number: Default string
        Asset Tag: Default string
        Features:
                Board is a hosting board
                Board is replaceable
        Location In Chassis: Default string
        Chassis Handle: 0x0003
        Type: Motherboard
        Contained Object Handles: 0

Handle 0x0021, DMI type 10, 6 bytes
...

   Here is a one liner
$> sudo dmidecode -s baseboard-product-name
H110M-H-CF
$>

   On another older pc with intel motherboard, I get this:
$> sudo dmidecode -t baseboard | grep -i 'Product'
        Product Name: DG35EC

2. inxi
   The inxi command with the --machine or -M option will show motherboard information. You can use the
   -x option further to show additional details about the motherboard. Run it with sudo to extract
   maximum details.

   First install inxi with apt:
$> sudo apt install inxi

   On my main ubuntu desktop machine this is the output:
$> sudo inxi --machine
Machine:
  Type: Desktop System: Gigabyte product: H110M-H v: N/A serial: N/A
  Mobo: Gigabyte model: H110M-H-CF v: x.x serial: N/A
    UEFI-[Legacy]: American Megatrends v: F20 date: 11/16/2016
$>

   On my older intel motherboard machine this is the output:
$> inxi -M
Machine:   Mobo: Intel model: DG35EC version: AAE29266-210
           Bios: Intel version: ECG3510M.86A.0112.2009.0203.1136 date: 02/03/2009

3. lshw
   The lshw (list hardware) command is quite effective in showing details and information about most
   hardware components. It has separate options to report only specific parts of the hardware like
   memory, network, disk drives etc. However there is no option to report just motherboard.

   Use apt to install lshw on ubuntu, debian, linux mint and related distros:
$> sudo apt install lshw

   The motherboard information is reported right on top when full details are printed using the lshw
   command. We shall use the less command to make the top part visible.
$> sudo lshw | less

   Here is the output from my ubuntu 23.10 machine.

   Note that on the top part, the motherboard vendor, product name and the firmware details are
   displayed. In this case the vendor is Gigabyte Technology, the product model is H110M-H-CF and the
   BIOS vendor is American Megatrends Inc. and the version is F20 (which is actually UEFI).

4. Hardinfo
   The hardinfo command is a gui tool and quite easy to use. It reports details about most hardware
   components including the motherboard. It is a must have hardware analysis tool for your ubuntu
   desktop machine.

   Installing is easy. Just run the apt command
$> sudo apt install hardinfo

   Now run it directly from the application menu of your desktop environment or run the command from the
   terminal.
$> hardinfo

   Note that the first page on "Computer Summary" shows the motherboard vendor and the model name. Users
   who do not want to use the terminal or commands can use this application.

5. System Files - /sys/devices
   Another smart way to check motherboard information is by reading some dynamic files that are
   populated with hardware information by the kernel. The files are located in
   /sys/devices/virtual/dmi/id/.

   Here is a sample output from my ubuntu desktop machine.
$> cat /sys/devices/virtual/dmi/id/board_{vendor,name,version}
Gigabyte Technology Co., Ltd.
H110M-H-CF
x.x
$>

   It is possible to extract more information like this:
$> cat /sys/devices/virtual/dmi/id/*

   Here are some fancy one lines
$> grep . /sys/devices/virtual/dmi/id/* 2>/dev/null

   In the following output we can also check the exact BIOS/UEFI firmware version and release date. This
   allows us to check whether we need to update the bios or not.
$> grep . /sys/devices/virtual/dmi/id/* 2>/dev/null
/sys/devices/virtual/dmi/id/bios_date:11/16/2016
/sys/devices/virtual/dmi/id/bios_release:5.12

$>

   Here is a similar one-line using the tail command, which is a bit more readable:
$> tail -n +1  /sys/devices/virtual/dmi/id/* 2>/dev/null

or

$> tail /sys/devices/virtual/dmi/id/* 2>/dev/null

or

$> tail -v -n +1  /sys/devices/virtual/dmi/id/* 2>/dev/null

   The output on my Ubuntu machine:
$> tail -n +1  /sys/devices/virtual/dmi/id/* 2>/dev/null

Other Commands
   There are many other commands for extracting hardware info on linux, but a lot of them do not report
   motherboard specific details directly. For instance the lspci command will show the chipset name in
   some places and vendor but will not show the motherboard model.

   Similarly the hwinfo shows a lot of useful information about various hardware components but does not
   show the motherboard specifics.

Conclusion
   Those were some of the commands that can be used to fetch and display information about the
   motherboard on your system. If you know of any other newer command please let us know in the comments
   below.
