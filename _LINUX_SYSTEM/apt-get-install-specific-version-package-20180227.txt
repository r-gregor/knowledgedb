How to Install Specific Version of Package using apt-get
February 22, 2018

   To handle Debian-based system packages, we use the apt-get command. This command requires
   administrative rights to work. It contains several options that make it possible to manipulate the
   packages through some operations like the installation, update or deletion, and many others. The
   beautiful thing is the fact that it allows installing a specific version of a package and the purpose
   of this tutorial we are using Ubuntu 16.04 version.

1) Check the available versions of packages
   Sometimes you can face issues or bug with a version of a package, this may cause you to choose a
   version which doesn't encounter bugs. Before installing, it is possible to check the
   available versions of a package with the apt-cache madison command. The syntax is
   [INS: :INS]
apt-cache madison package

   You can see the output below
$ apt-cache madison virtualbox
virtualbox | 5.0.40-dfsg-0ubuntu1.16.04.2 | http://cm.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu xenial-updates/multiverse amd6
4 Packages
virtualbox | 5.0.18-dfsg-2build1 | http://cm.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu xenial/multiverse amd64 Packages

   You can also use the syntax command below
apt-cache policy package

   just as below
$ apt-cache policy virtualbox
virtualbox:
 Installed: (none)
 Candidate: 5.0.40-dfsg-0ubuntu1.16.04.2
 Version table:
 5.0.40-dfsg-0ubuntu1.16.04.2 500
 500 http://cm.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu xenial-updates/multiverse amd64 Packages
 5.0.18-dfsg-2build1 500
 500 http://cm.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu xenial/multiverse amd64 Packages

   Then, with one of the two commands, you can decide to check the available version of a package with
   the releases versions on the official site or on the official GitHub.

2) Install a specific version of a package
   When you have listed the versions to choose the specific one, you can install it with the apt-get
   install command followed by the name and the version of the package. So, you need to follow the
   syntax as below:
apt-get install package=version -V

   The -V parameter helps to have more details about the installation

   Practically, you can do as below:
# apt-get install virtualbox=5.0.18-dfsg-2build1 -V
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree
Reading state information... Done
The following additional packages will be installed:
   dkms (2.2.0.3-2ubuntu11.5)
   libgsoap8 (2.8.28-1)
   libqt4-opengl (4:4.8.7+dfsg-5ubuntu2)
   libsdl1.2debian (1.2.15+dfsg1-3)
   libvncserver1 (0.9.10+dfsg-3ubuntu0.16.04.1)
   virtualbox-dkms (5.0.40-dfsg-0ubuntu1.16.04.2)
....................

a. Simulate the installation
   For some reason, you could need to make sure that the installation will not encounter any problem. To
   do that, it is possible to simulate the installation with the -s parameter respecting the syntax
# apt-get install -s package

   as below
# apt-get install -s virtualbox=5.0.18-dfsg-2build1

   You can see that it shows the process of the installation but it is a just a simulation.

b. List the installed packages with the versions
   You can need to check the version of an installed package. You can do it with the dpkg command
   combined with grep followed by the name of the package
# dpkg -l | grep virtualbox
ii  unity-scope-virtualbox    0.1+13.10.20130723-0ubuntu1     all      VirtualBox scope for Unity
ii  virtualbox                5.0.18-dfsg-2build1             amd64    x86 virtualization solution - base binaries
ii  virtualbox-dkms           5.0.40-dfsg-0ubuntu1.16.04.2    all      x86 virtualization solution - kernel module sources for dkms

   If you want to filter the information, you can use the command as below
# dpkg -l | grep '^ii' | grep virtualbox | awk '{print $2 "\t" $3}'
unity-scope-virtualbox  0.1+13.10.20130723-0ubuntu1
virtualbox       5.0.18-dfsg-2build1
virtualbox-dkms  5.0.40-dfsg-0ubuntu1.16.04.2

   To list all the installed packages with version, you can omit the grep followed by the name of a
   specific package.

   Install a specific version of a package can be useful to avoid the bugs when you know which version
   of a package is concerned and make sure to disable specific package upgrade (in /etc/yum.conf
   file )so it won't get automatically upgraded when run yum update.
