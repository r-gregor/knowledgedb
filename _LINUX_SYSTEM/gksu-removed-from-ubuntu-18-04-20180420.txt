gksu Removed From Ubuntu, Here's The Recommended Replacement
April 19, 2018

Ubuntu 18.04 no gksu
   The gksu package, which provides GTK+ front-ends for su (gksu) and sudo (gksudo), was [26]removed
   from the Ubuntu 18.04 repositories, so it won't be available starting with this Ubuntu release.
   gksu is used to allow elevating your permissions when running graphical applications, for example in
   case you want to run a graphical text editor as root to edit a system file, or to be able to remove
   or add a file to a system folder.

How to edit system files using a GUI without gksu?
   Enter admin://. The recommended way of performing operations that require elevated permissions
   using a GUI is by using the gvfs admin backend, which is available in both Ubuntu 18.04 LTS and
   17.10, by using the admin:// prefix.
   All you have to do is open Nautilus, press Ctrl + L so you can type in its address bar, and type
   admin:// followed by the path of the folder containing the file you want to edit, and enter your
   password. After doing this, you can use any GUI application to alter system files, like Nautilus to
   add / delete files or folders, Gedit to edit text file, and so on.

admin instead of gksu ubuntu

   Here's an example. Let's say you want to edit the Grub file. Instead of using gksu gedit
   /etc/default/grub, you can open Nautilus and type: admin:///etc/default. You'll be asked for your
   password and after you enter it, you can open the grub file with Gedit, then save it.
   Note that there are 3 forward slashes after admin: because 2 are required by default and the 3rd is
   from the path that follows, which begins with a slash: /etc/default. One more thing: in Nautilus,
   don't enter the direct path to a file but to a folder containing the file you want to edit.
   In the same way you can run Gedit from a terminal to open a system file and edit it, for example:
gedit admin:///etc/default/grub

   This will prompt for your password and then open the file in Gedit, allowing you to edit it.
