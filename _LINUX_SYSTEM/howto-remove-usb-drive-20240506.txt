How to Safely Eject a USB Drive in Linux
May 6, 2024

   When using a USB drive on a Linux system, it's important to properly unmount and remove the drive to
   prevent data loss or corruption. Simply unplugging the drive without properly unmounting it can lead
   to issues.

   In this guide, we'll learn the simple steps and important safety tips for safely ejecting USB drives
   using the Linux command line.

Identify the USB Drive in Linux
   First, you need to identify the device name of your USB drive by running the following lsblk
   command, which will list all block devices connected to your system.
$> lsblk

   The above command displays all the storage devices connected to your system. Look for your USB drive
   in the list, which is usually labeled as /dev/sdX, where 'X' represents a letter (e.g., /dev/sdb,
   /dev/sdc, etc.).

   In this example, the USB drive is identified as `/dev/sdc`. Make a note of this label; we'll need it
   for the next step.

Unmount the USB Drive in Linux
   Next, you need to unmount the USB drive by running the following umount command, specifying the mount
   point of the USB drive.
$> sudo umount /dev/sdc
$> lsblk

Safely Remove the USB Drive in Linux
   After unmounting the drive, you can safely remove it from your system by running the following eject
   command.
$> sudo eject /dev/sdc

   This will power down the USB drive and allow you to safely remove it.

   Another way to safely remove a USB drive is to use the `udisksctl` command, which is part of the
   `udisks` package, that provides a command-line interface for interacting with storage devices.
$> sudo udisksctl unmount -b /dev/sdc

   Then, power off the drive:
$> sudo udisksctl power-off -b /dev/sdc

   After running these commands, you can safely remove the USB drive.

Conclusion
   Safely removing a USB drive in Linux is an important step to prevent data loss or corruption. By
   following the steps outlined above, you can properly unmount and remove your USB drive using the
   Linux command line.

   Remember, it's always better to take the extra time to safely remove a drive than to risk losing your
   data.
