Linux:Copy, change permissions and ownership of a file in a command

   Posted in [35]Administration by [36]Surendra Anne On June 10, 2015[37]. 3 Comments

   Today I came across a requirement to copy couple of files and change permissions to execute those
   files when writing some ansible playbooks. We can do this by using cp, [38]chmod, [39]chown command
   as shown below. Ownership is changed from root user to normal user surendra.
        ls -l abc.sh

   output:

   -rw-r–r– 1 root root 0 Jun 10 21:22 abc.sh

        cp abc.sh /tmp/

        chmod 755 /tmp/abc.sh

        chown surendra.surendra /tmp/abc.sh

   ls -l /tmp/abc.sh

   Output:
   -rwxr-xr-x 1 surendra surendra 0 Jun 10 21:23 /tmp/abc.sh

   I can execute these commands with out any problem, but if you want to do same activity on a regular
   basis then it is time consuming task and more over keeping these commands in ansible play-book is not
   a great option. How about if we have a command in Linux which do all these stuff in one shot? Yes, we
   have a command called "install" which do this all in one command. The equivalent install command of
   above three commands is below.
        install -v -g surendra -o surendra -m a+x abc.sh /tmp/abc.sh

   To understand above command we should know couple of options for install command. Below examples will
   help you to understand install command with ease.

   Example: Just copy a file from one location to other and do not bother about permissions and
   ownership.
        install abc.sh /tmp

   Example: Copy a file with different permissions, for example every user in my machine should have
   execute permission on the file
        install -m a+x abc.sh /tmp/

   Note: -m option arguments will be similar to chmod arguments.

   Example: Copy a file with different permissions, for example full permissions for a file for all the
   users.
        install -m 777 abc.sh /tmp/

   Example: Copy a file with different owner name
        install -m 755 -o surendra abc.sh /tmp/

   Example: Copy a file with different group owner
        install -m 755 -o surendra -g surendra abc.sh /tmp/

   Example: Copy a file with preserved time stamp
        install -p -m 755 -o surendra -g surendra abc.sh /tmp/

   Example: Copy file in verbose mode so that we can see what is happening.
        install -v -p -m 755 -o surendra -g surendra abc.sh /tmp/

   Output:
        removed ‘/tmp/abc.sh’

        ‘abc.sh’ -> ‘/tmp/abc.sh’
