How To List Startup Services At Boot In Linux
September 4, 2020

   By default, some important system services are started automatically when the system boots. For
   instance, the NetworkManager and Firewalld services will be automatically started at system boot. The
   startup services are also known as daemons in Linux and Unix-like operating systems. They will keep
   running in the background and do their job without any user intervention. In addition to the system
   services, some other third-party applications will also add themselves to the startup. In this brief
   guide, let us see how to find and list startup services at boot time in Linux and Unix-like systems.

List Startup Services At Boot In Linux
   Finding the list of startup services will differ depending upon the init system. Systemd is the
   default init system for the major newer versions of Linux distributions.

   If your systems runs with systemd system manager, you can list all services with the following
   command:
$ sudo systemctl list-unit-files --type=service

   Sample output:
UNIT FILE                                  STATE           VENDOR PRESET
accounts-daemon.service                    enabled         enabled
acpid.service                              disabled        enabled
alsa-restore.service                       static          enabled
alsa-state.service                         static          enabled
alsa-utils.service                         masked          enabled
anacron.service                            enabled         enabled
apparmor.service                           enabled         enabled

   List all services in Linux with systemd List all services in Linux with systemd List all services in
   Linux with systemd

   As stated above, this command shows the list of all services (both enabled and disabled at system
   boot) in your Linux system. You can verify it by looking under the STATE section in the above output.
   The services that are started at boot are marked as enabled, and the services that are not started
   are marked as disabled.

   To list only the enabled services at system boot, run:
$ sudo systemctl list-unit-files --type=service --state=enabled --all

   Sample output:
UNIT FILE                                  STATE    VENDOR PRESET
accounts-daemon.service                    enabled  enabled
anacron.service                            enabled  enabled
apparmor.service                           enabled  enabled
[email protected]                          enabled  enabled
avahi-daemon.service                       enabled  enabled
.   
.   
.   
udisks2.service                            enabled  enabled
ufw.service                                enabled  enabled
unattended-upgrades.service                enabled  enabled
vboxweb.service                            enabled  enabled
wpa_supplicant.service                     enabled  enabled

74 unit files listed.

   To list all disabled services at system boot, run:
$ sudo systemctl list-unit-files --type=service --state=disabled --all

   Like I already said, some older Linux distributions may use either SysV or Upstart as their default
   init system.

   If your system uses sysv, run the following command to list all services:
$ sudo service --status-all

   Sample output:
 [ + ]  acpid
 [ - ]  alsa-utils
 [ - ]  anacron
 [ + ]  apparmor
 [ + ]  apport
 [ + ]  avahi-daemon
 [ + ]  bluetooth
 [ - ]  console-setup.sh
 [ + ]  cron
 [ - ]  cryptdisks
 [ - ]  cryptdisks-early
 [ + ]  cups
 [ + ]  cups-browsed
 [ + ]  dbus
 [ - ]  dns-clean
 [ + ]  dnsmasq
 [ + ]  exim4
 [ + ]  gdm3
 [ + ]  grub-common
 [ + ]  hddtemp
 [ - ]  hwclock.sh
 [ + ]  irqbalance
 [ + ]  kerneloops
 [ - ]  keyboard-setup.sh
 [ + ]  kmod
 [ + ]  lm-sensors
 [ - ]  lvm2
 [ - ]  lvm2-lvmpolld
 [ + ]  network-manager
 [ + ]  networking
 [ + ]  openvpn
 [ - ]  plymouth
 [ - ]  plymouth-log
 [ - ]  pppd-dns
 [ + ]  procps
 [ - ]  pulseaudio-enable-autospawn
 [ - ]  rsync
 [ + ]  rsyslog
 [ - ]  saned
 [ - ]  screen-cleanup
 [ + ]  smartmontools
 [ - ]  speech-dispatcher
 [ - ]  spice-vdagent
 [ + ]  sysstat
 [ + ]  udev
 [ + ]  ufw
 [ + ]  unattended-upgrades
 [ - ]  uuidd
 [ + ]  virtualbox
 [ - ]  whoopsie
 [ - ]  x11-common

   Here, the + indicates the service is running, and - indicates a stopped service. If you see ? in the
   output, the service state cannot be determined (for some reason).

   To list all services which are enabled at boot, run:
$ sudo chkconfig --list

   This command will list status of each service on each run level. A sample output of the above
   command will be:
acpid           0:off   1:off   2:on    3:on    4:on    5:on    6:off
anamon          0:off   1:off   2:off   3:off   4:off   5:off   6:off
atd             0:off   1:off   2:off   3:on    4:on    5:on    6:off
[...]

   In the above command, "on" means the service is started at boot.

   You can also view the status of a specific service at different run level like below:
$ sudo chkconfig --list httpd

   If you Linux system uses upstart, run this command to list all startup services:
$ sudo initctl list

   The above command will show all Session jobs.

   If you want to show all System jobs, run:
$ sudo initctl --system list

   To list all services and show their statuses at each run level, run:
$ sudo initctl list | awk '{ print $1 }' | xargs -n1 initctl show-config

   To show the state of a specific service, run this command:
$ initctl show-config <service_name>

Disable startup services
   The more applications you install on your computer, the longer it takes for your system to boot. In
   order to improve your Linux system's boot time, you need to find the unnecessary services and disable
   them.

   Say for example, if you don't want a service called unattended-upgrades.service to load at startup,
   you can disable it using command:
$ sudo systemctl disable --now unattended-upgrades.service

   To know if a service is enabled at boot time, run:
$ sudo systemctl is-enabled <service-name>
