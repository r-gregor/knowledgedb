How to Remove Snap Packages in Ubuntu Linux

   A tutorial on how to remove Snap from Ubuntu Linux and get a snap-free system.

   Snap packages developed by Canonical are beneficial for several use cases. It provides an easy and
   faster update of applications directly to the end-users. Not only that, it has several other
   benefits, such as it comes with all dependencies packaged and allows multiple installations of the
   same applications. Furthermore, it runs in a sandbox mode, providing security and other benefits.

   Among all these benefits, there are other debatable drawbacks of Snap tech. For example, almost every
   user who used Snap reported its slower performance, including its startup time, compared to native
   deb or RPM packages. In addition, due to its design, the application installation size is huge and
   costs disk space because it packages all the dependencies.

   Not only that but due to its sandbox nature, the Snap apps may not access several areas of your Linux
   desktop until managed with proper permission.

   This guide explains how you can remove the snap from the Ubuntu system altogether.

   These steps are tested in Ubuntu 22.04 LTS Jammy Jellyfish and Ubuntu 23.10. However, it should
   work for all applicable Ubuntu versions.

   Warning: These steps will remove Software and Firefox, the two critical applications in your Ubuntu
   system. Make sure you take backups of bookmarks and other Firefox settings before trying these steps.


Remove Snap Packages in Ubuntu Linux
    1. Open a terminal and view the list of Snap packages installed in your system using the below
       command. It shows the snap packages such as Firefox, Software store, themes and other core
       packages installed by default.
$> snap list

    2. Remove snap packages in the following order. Firstly, remove Firefox. Secondly, snap-store and
       the other packages that you see in the above command output in your system.
$> sudo snap remove --purge firefox
$> sudo snap remove --purge snap-store
$> sudo snap remove --purge gnome-3-38-2004
$> sudo snap remove --purge gtk-common-themes
$> sudo snap remove --purge snapd-desktop-integration
$> sudo snap remove --purge bare
$> sudo snap remove --purge core20
$> sudo snap remove --purge snapd

    3. Finally, remove the snap daemon via apt command.
$> sudo apt remove --autoremove snapd

   That's not all. Even if you removed the snaps using the above command, the sudo apt update command
   again brings back the snap if you don't stop the apt trigger.

    4. So, to stop that, we need to create an apt preference file in /etc/apt/preferences.d/ and create
       a new preference file to stop snap. Create a new file called nosnap.pref in /etc/apt/preferences.d/
$> sudo -H gedit /etc/apt/preferences.d/nosnap.pref

    5. And add the following lines, then save the file.

Package: snapd
Pin: release a=*
Pin-Priority: -10

   The apt preference is a potent tool if you know how to use it. For example, in the above statements,
   the Pin-Priority -10 means preventing a package from installation.

   Unrelated to this tutorial, for example, if you want to give super high priority to all the packages
   from distribution code name=bullseye, then one may see these preferences. If you want to learn more,
   you can visit the apt man pages.

Package: *
Pin: release n=bullseye
Pin-Priority: 900

    6. Returning to the topic, once you save and close the above file, run the below again from the
       terminal.
$> sudo apt update

    7. Finally, the steps are complete for getting rid of the snap from Ubuntu.
   You removed Firefox and Sofware applications, so you need those for your work.

   You can use the following command to install the apt version of the Gnome Software. Make sure you use
   the --install-suggests. Otherwise, it will install the snap version again!
$> sudo apt install --install-suggests gnome-software

   And to install firefox, use the official PPA via the below commands.
$> sudo add-apt-repository ppa:mozillateam/ppa
$> sudo apt update
$> sudo apt install -t 'o=LP-PPA-mozillateam' firefox

   Once you have installed Firefox, enable the automatic update using the below commands. To learn more,
   visit this[https://www.debugpoint.com/2021/09/remove-firefox-snap-ubuntu/] page.
$> echo 'Unattended-Upgrade::Allowed-Origins:: "LP-PPA-mozillateam:${distro_codename}";' | \
	sudo tee /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/51unattended-upgrades-firefox

   Last but not least, create another preference file for Firefox to give super high priority to the
   above PPA while running apt. If you don't do this, the apt update command again pulls back firefox
   snap and brings over all snap packages.
$> sudo -H gedit /etc/apt/preferences.d/mozillateamppa

   Finally, add these lines and save the file.

Package: firefox*
Pin: release o=LP-PPA-mozillateam
Pin-Priority: 501

   That's it.

Revert back to Snap in Ubuntu
   If you change your mind, remove the preference file and install the applications using the below
   commands.
$> sudo rm /etc/apt/preferences.d/nosnap.pref
$> sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
$> sudo snap install snap-store
$> sudo apt install firefox

Closing Notes
   Wrapping up the tutorial on removing snap in Ubuntu, I would say these are unnecessary efforts to
   eliminate Snap completely. Mainly, these are difficult for new users. I hope this guide helps you to
   get rid of snap. Cheers.

   Updated based on Ubuntu 23.10 test.
