How and Why to Change the Default SSH Port on Linux
August 22, 2020

   In this tutorial, we will show you how to change the SSH default port in Linux, and go over why
   changing this default port is a good idea. IMPORTANT: Before we go any further, you should understand
   that this is not a solution that will prevent or deter a determined hacker to attack your SSH
   service. It is merely a measure to help you avoid the thousands or automated bots running all the
   time scanning vast ranges of IP space searching for standard SSH ports being open. Preventing a
   determined hacker from brute-forcing your SSH service is beyond the scope of this article.

   SSH, also known as Secure Shell, is the most widely-used protocol for connecting to and managing
   Linux systems remotely. SSH offers strong encryption and authentication along with excellent
   customizability, and using SSH gives you the freedom of accessing a remote machine. You can run
   services and software as if you were physically using the machine, no matter where you are.

   By default, SSH runs on port 22. Since this is common knowledge, this port often becomes a target for
   brute force attacks. Because this provides full access to your server's OS, people with malicious
   intent will often target port 22 more than any other port. Changing the default SSH port will prevent
   automated attacks that don't spend the time to rotate ports when targeting a Linux Server. To protect
   your server from a brute force attack, you should change the default SSH port to something else.

Prerequisites
     * A Linux VPS with root access enabled, or a user with sudo privileges. Our VPSes all come with
       root access, so you should have no issues if you use one of our Managed Linux VPSes.

Step 1. Connect via SSH
   Log in to your server using SSH as the root user (or as a user with sudo privileges). You can do that
   by entering this command:
$> ssh root@Server_IP_Address -p Port_Number

   Remember to replace 'root' with your username if you are not using the root user. Also, replace
   Server_IP_Address and Port_Number with your actual IP address and SSH port number. If you have never
   changed the port number before, this should be 22.

   Once you are logged in, you can proceed to the next step.

Step 2. Select a New Port Number
   Before changing the default SSH port, you will need to select a new port for SSH to listen on. You
   can select any unused port. In Linux, port numbers below 1024 are reserved for well-known services
   and could be more easily discovered. So it is recommended to select a port above 1024.

   As an example, we will change the default SSH port to 5437.

Step 3. Configure the Firewall
   Before changing the default SSH port, you will need to configure the firewall on your server to allow
   traffic on the new SSH port.

   On Ubuntu/Debian-based operating systems, you can open the new SSH port 5437 using the UFW command:
$> ufw allow 5437/tcp
$> ufw reload

   On CentOS/RHEL/Fedora-based operating systems, you can open the new SSH port 5437 using the
   firewall-cmd command:
$> firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=public --add-port=5437/tcp
$> firewall-cmd --reload

   At this point, your server is configured to allow traffic on the new SSH port.

Step 4. Change the Default SSH Port
   You can change the SSH default port by editing the file /etc/ssh/sshd_config.
$> nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config

   Find the following line:
# Port 22

   Uncomment the line by removing the pound symbol "#" , then replace it with the following line:
Port 5437

   Save and close the file when you are finished. Then, restart the SSH service to apply the changes.
$> systemctl restart ssh

   Next, verify the SSH listening port with the following command:
$> netstat -plntu | grep 5437

   You should see the following output:
tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:5437            0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      5134/sshd
tcp6       0      0 :::5437                 :::*                    LISTEN      5134/sshd

Step 5. Connect to SSH using the new Port
   Now, log out from your current SSH session and connect your server again using the new port.
$> ssh -p 5437 root@Server_IP_Address

   If everything is fine, you should connect to the server and see a password prompt with no problems.

   Congratulations! You have successfully changed the default SSH port on your Linux machine.

   You don't have to change the default SSH port in your Linux VPS on your own if you use one of our
   fully managed web hosting solutions. Our technical support team will gladly help you change your
   SSH port to a custom one without you having to do a thing. They are available 24/7 and will help you
   any aspect of managing your server.
