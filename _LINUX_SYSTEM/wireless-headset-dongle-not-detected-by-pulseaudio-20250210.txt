Wireless headset dongle not detected by PulseAudio
February 7, 2025

   For whatever reason, when I plug and unplug my Wireless Headset dongle over USB, it is not always
   detected by the PulseAudio/Pipewire stack which is running our desktop sound Linux those days. But we
   can fix that with a restart of the handling daemon, see below.

   In PulseAudio terminology an input device (microphone) is called a source, and an output device a
   sink.

   When the headset dongle is plugged in, we can see it on the USB bus:
$> lsusb | grep Headset
Bus 001 Device 094: ID 046d:0af7 Logitech, Inc. Logitech G PRO X 2 Gaming Headset

   The device is detected correctly as a Human Interface Device (HID) device
$> dmesg
...
[310230.507591] input: Logitech Logitech G PRO X 2 Gaming Headset as /devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:14.0/usb1/1-1/1-1.1/1-1.1.4/1-1.1.4:1.3/0003:046D:0AF7.0060/input/input163
[310230.507762] hid-generic 0003:046D:0AF7.0060: input,hiddev2,hidraw11: USB HID v1.10 Device [Logitech Logitech G PRO X 2 Gaming Headset] on usb-0000:00:14.0-1.1.4/input

   However it is not seen in the list of sources / sinks of PulseAudio:
$> pactl list short sinks
58 alsa_output.usb-Lenovo_ThinkPad_Thunderbolt_3_Dock_USB_Audio_000000000000-00.analog-stereo  PipeWire  s16le 2ch 48000Hz  IDLE
62 alsa_output.pci-0000_00_1f.3.analog-stereo                                                  PipeWire  s32le 2ch 48000Hz  SUSPENDED
95 bluez_output.F4_4E_FD_D2_97_1F.1                                                            PipeWire  s16le 2ch 48000Hz  IDLE

   This unfriendly list shows my docking station, which as a small jack connector for a wired cable, the
   built in speaker of my laptop, and a blutooth headset.

   If I restart Pipewire,
$> systemctl --user restart pipewire

   then the headset appears as possible audio output.
$ pactl list short sinks
54  alsa_output.usb-Lenovo_ThinkPad_Thunderbolt_3_Dock_USB_Audio_000000000000-00.analog-stereo    PipeWire  s16le 2ch 48000Hz  SUSPENDED
56  alsa_output.usb-Logitech_Logitech_G_PRO_X_2_Gaming_Headset_0000000000000000-00.analog-stereo  PipeWire  s16le 2ch 48000Hz  SUSPENDED
58  alsa_output.pci-0000_00_1f.3.analog-stereo                                                    PipeWire  s32le 2ch 48000Hz  SUSPENDED
77  bluez_output.F4_4E_FD_D2_97_1F.1                                                              PipeWire  s16le 2ch 48000Hz  SUSPENDED

   Once you have set the default input / output device, for me in Gnome, you can check it with:
$> pactl info | egrep '(Sink|Source)'
Default Sink: alsa_output.usb-Logitech_Logitech_G_PRO_X_2_Gaming_Headset_0000000000000000-00.analog-stereo
Default Source: alsa_input.usb-Logitech_Logitech_G_PRO_X_2_Gaming_Headset_0000000000000000-00.mono-fallback

   Finally let us play some test sounds:
$> speaker-test --test wav --nloops 1 --channels 2

   And test some recording, you will hear the output around one second after the speaking (yes that is
   recorded audio sent over a Unix pipe for playing !):
# don't do this when the output is a speaker, this will create audio feedback (larsen effect)
$> arecord -f cd - | aplay
