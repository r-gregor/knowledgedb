How to Setup APT Proxy on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS

   A proxy server is an intermediate server that sits between the client computer and the internet.
   Generally, it is used in the internal networks for unexpected access and to prevent attacks. It is
   also used to control internet access, bandwidth control and content filtering and blocking.

   If your office or home network is behind a proxy server then you will need to set up a proxy in your
   web browser or network proxy setting to access the internet.

export https_proxy=username:[26][email protected]:8182

   Save and close the file then activate the new proxy setting with the following command:
source ~/.bashrc

   /etc/environment file:
