How to use SSHFS to mount remote Linux partitions in Linux and Windows

   SSHFS is a Linux filesystem client, based on FUSE,  that can be used to mount a remote
   Linux partition over SSH. The interaction between two machines is done over SSH File
   Transfer Protocol or simply SFTP.

   This can be extremely useful to developers who need to frequently modify files and upload
   them on to a server. With SSHFS you can mount the remote partition on the local machine and
   work on files as if you are working locally.

   With SSHFS you can modify files locally and the changes will appear on the remote
   machine immediately. Of course there are many other reasons why you may want to mount a
   remote partition, but we won’t indulge ourselves with that argument.

   Some of you may also ask why not use NFS (Network FileSystem). NFS is useful and is a bit
   faster, but is not encrypted. This is one of the advantages of SSHFS that needs to be taken
   into consideration when choosing between NFS and SSHFS.

The installation

   The install process is really simple. You can complete it by running one of the following
   commands based on your distribution:
sudo apt-get install sshfs

   or:
sudo yum install sshfs

   On Windows, you will need to [32]download the latest win-sshfs package from Google
   repository.

   I will cover the setup and usage of SSHFS after the Linux part.

Mount a remote filesystem

   I will provide instructions for both Linux and Windows. Let’s start with Linux. First
   create the mount point to mount the remote filesystem:
sudo mkdir /mnt/local-dir

   Depending on the way you use SSH to your remote machine, you can use SSHFS with SSH
   password or key. To use a password you can use:
sudo sshfs root@remote-ip-address:/ /mnt/local-dir

   To mount the filesystem with an SSH key you can use:
sudo sshfs -o IdentityFile=~/.ssh/id_rsa root@remote-IP-address:/ /mnt/local-dir

   If you are using SSH on a different port, you will need to specify the port with the “-p”
   argument.

   Here is a real world example:
[root@hostname marin]# sshfs -p17170 marin@xxx-xxx-xxx-xxx:/home/marin/ /mnt/work/
marin@hostname's password:
[root@hostname marin]# df -h
Filesystem Size Used Avail Use% Mounted on
/dev/vda1 30G 19G 9.1G 68% /
tmpfs 499M 0 499M 0% /dev/shm
marin@xxx-xxx-xxx-xxx:/home/marin/
 193G 45G 138G 25% /mnt/work

   In the example above, I mounted the home partition of a remote server at ‘/mnt/work/’ on
   the local machine. All my files located on the remote server are now easily acessible from
   this mounted folder.

   It is important to note that this method temporary mounts the remote filesystem. In case of
   reboot of the remote or local system, you will need to follow the same steps to perform the
   mount.

Permanent mount

   If you want to mount the remote partitions permanently then the best solution is to edit
   the /etc/fstab file. The syntax of the mount point is:
sshfs#user@server:/remote/folder   /local/folder   fuse    defaults 0 0

   However I would not recommend you using this method as it can slow down the boot of your
   machine in case the remote server is not accessible at the moment. If you need to perform
   the mount frequently I would recommend you to add the mount commands in your .bashrc
   profile.

   Here is an example:
alias extstore="sshfs  [32][email protected]:/ /mnt/lo
calfolder/"

   Alternatively you can setup the command as bash script and set it to run automatically upon
   system startup.

Unmounting SSHFS

   It’s extremely easy to unmount remote directories:
sudo umount /mnt/local-dir

Using SSHFS in Windows

   In Windows, SSHFS comes with a graphical interface which is really easy to use. It has the
   following requirements:
     * Microsoft .NET Framework 4
     * Dokan Library 0.6.0

   Just install these packages and proceed with the installation which is no different than a
   typical software installation on Windows: double click on the setup file and click “Next”
   until the installation finishes. Note that if you are running Windows 8 or later, you will
   need to run the installer in compatibility mode for Windows 7. This can be done by right
   click on the file -> Properties -> Compatibility Tab -> Run this program in compatibility
   mode for: Windows 7.
   We are hiring! We are looking for tutorials, tips & tricks, reviews, and news analysis. If
   you are interested, [30]fill this form and contact us now!

   Once the install has finished, open the SSHFS manager:

   [31]sshfs-for-windows

   The fields in there are self explanatory and there is no need to stop and explain each one
   of them. The only thing worth mentioning is that if you are using private keys to access
   the remote partition, you can change the “Authentication Method” to “Private Key” and
   import your key afterwards.

   As you noticed SSHFS is available for multiple platforms and this includes Android as well.
   There is an ongoing development of a [32]SSHFS Android app that is currently in Alpha
   state. I find this app pretty useful when you are on the go and need to access files on
   your server. Even though I use SSH client on my phone I find it sometimes more useful to
   have a graphical interface to reach a file that I need to show or send to my colleagues.

   I hope this article will be useful for you. And as always if you have any questions or
   comments, please do not hesitate to post them in the comment section below.
