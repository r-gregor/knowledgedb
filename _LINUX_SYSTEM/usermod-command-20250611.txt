How to use usermod Command in Linux
June 09, 2025

   In this tutorial, you will learn how to use usermod command in Linux.

   You can use usermod command in Linux to edit any user's settings, easily from the terminal, you can
   for example edit : password, username, home location, add user or remove from groups etc.

1) How to change User's primary group
   To change a user's primary group, you can do so by using the command below.

   The command below will add username to sudo group, replace group and username with yours before
   executing this command.
$> sudo usermod -g sudo username

2)Add User to Multiple Groups
   Say you want to add username to sudo and www-data groups, to do so simply execute the command below
$> sudo usermod -aG sudo,www-data username

3) Change Home directory location
   If you want to set a new path as home directory for your user, then you must use the command below
$> sudo usermod -d /new/path/home/dir -m username

   The command above, will change the home directory path of username user to /new/path/home/dir

4) Set User's password
   Setting a new password for a user in Linux is very simple, and you can do so by using the usermod
   command with -p argument.
$> sudo usermod -p new_password username

   The command above will set this password new_password to the user account username

   Note: The password you set with this command is visible in the bash history, and /etc/shadow file, so
   to prevent this from happening I'd recommend using the following command instead
$> sudo passwd username

5) Rename a User
   To change the name of a user in Linux via usermod command , all you need to do is use -l argument.

   Here's how you can easily change your name via the usermod command
$> sudo usermod -l new_username old_username

   The command above will rename old_username to new_username, This means after changing the username,
   make sure to use the new username when logging in.

   The new username should appear in the /etc/shadow file.

6) Lock a User
   usermod command can also used to lock user accounts in Linux. If you need to lock a user acount,
   simply use the following command
$> sudo usermod -L username

7)Unlock a User
   To unlock a user that you previously locked, all you need to do is use the -U argument.
$> sudo usermod -U username

8)Change User's Shell
   The default shell in Linux is /bin/bash to change the default shell to another shell, before you do
   so make sure you have the new shell set up and ready to use

   For example, to replace bash /bin/bash shell with zsh shell bin/zsh for the username account, execute
$> sudo usermod -s /bin/zsh username

9)Set Expiry data for any user account
   The -e argument in usermod command allows you to set an expiry date for any user account in Linux. If
   you want an account to stop working after x period of time, then simply use the command below.
$> sudo usermod -e 2026-01-01 username

   The command above, means that the expiry date for account username is 2026-01-01, after this date the
   account will get disabled.

   To check the expiry date, you can use the chage command
$> sudo chage -l username

Conclusion
   In this tutorial, you learned how to use the usermod command in Linux. By now you should know what
   the usermod command is and what can be used for.
