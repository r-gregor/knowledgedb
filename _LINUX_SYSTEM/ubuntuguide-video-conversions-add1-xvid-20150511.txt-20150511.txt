[7]Using Mencoder Profiles

   Posted by admin on January 21, 2015 under [8]Tech Tips | [9]5 Comments to Read

   Here’s a quick tip on using Mencoder profiles that serve as shortcuts for all of your favorite
   settings. This can save you a lot of time, especially when your encoding syntax is lengthy and
   difficult to remember.

   Profiles are stored in the mencoder.conf file located in the appropriate place for your operating
   system. For Linux users, you can create a personalized file in your own home directory,
   ~/.mplayer/mencoder.conf.

   Here’s the syntax you might use on a single-pass XviD project without using profiles.

     mencoder -oac mp3lame -lameopts aq=0:q=0 -ovc xvid -xvidencopts
     fixed_quant=2:max_key_interval=25:vhq=2:bvhq=1:chroma_opt:quant_type=mpeg
     input.avi -o output.avi

   Compare that with the following examples of some of my favorite profiles, and how easy it is to use
   them.

   XviD Single-pass Profile Example

     [xvid]
     profile-desc="MPEG4/MP3 encoding"
     ovc=xvid=1
     xvidencopts=fixed_quant=2:max_key_interval=25:vhq=2:bvhq=1:chroma_opt=1:quant_type=mpeg
     oac=mp3lame=1
     lameopts=aq=0:q=0

     mencoder -profile xvid input.avi -o output.avi

   XviD 2-pass Profile Examples

     [xvid-pass1]
     profile-desc="MPEG4/MP3 encoding - PASS 1"
     ovc=xvid=1
     xvidencopts=pass=1:max_key_interval=25:turbo=1:vhq=0
     nosound=1
     o=/dev/null
     passlogfile=xvid-pass1.log

     [xvid-pass2]
     profile-desc="MPEG4/MP3 encoding - PASS 2"
     ovc=xvid=1
     xvidencopts=pass=2:max_key_interval=25:vhq=2:bvhq=1:chroma_opt=1:quant_type=mpeg:bitrate=2000
     oac=mp3lame=1
     lameopts=aq=0:q=0
     passlogfile=xvid-pass1.log

     mencoder -profile xvid-pass1 input.avi
     mencoder -profile xvid-pass2 input.avi -o output.avi

   x264 2-pass Profile Examples

     [x264-pass1]
     profile-desc="x264 encoding - PASS 1"
     ovc=x264=1
     x264encopts=pass=1:threads=0:subq=1:frameref=1:bframes=3:b_pyramid=normal:weight_b=1:keyint=25
     nosound=1
     o=/dev/null
     passlogfile=x264-pass1.log

     [x264-pass2]
     profile-desc="x264 encoding - PASS 2"
     ovc=x264=1
     x264encopts=pass=2:threads=0:subq=6:frameref=5:partitions=all:8x8dct=1:me=umh:bframes=3:b_pyramid=
     normal:weight_b=1:keyint=25:bitrate=2000
     oac=mp3lame=1
     lameopts=aq=0:q=0
     passlogfile=x264-pass1.log

     mencoder -profile x264-pass1 input.avi
     mencoder -profile x264-pass2 input.avi -o output.avi

   x264 Single-pass Profile Example

     [x264]
     profile-desc="x264 encoding"
     ovc=x264=1
     x264encopts=crf=20:threads=0:subq=6:frameref=5:partitions=all:8x8dct=1:me=umh:bframes=3:b_pyramid=
     normal:weight_b=1:keyint=25

     oac=mp3lame=1
     lameopts=aq=0:q=0

     mencoder -profile x264 input.avi -o output.avi

[15]Adding Chapters to Videos Using MKV Containers

   Posted by admin on November 4, 2014 under [16]Tech Tips | [17]4 Comments to Read

   If you would like to add chapters to your video files, such as XviD, x264, OGG, etc., simply use the
   [18]Matroska multimedia container format.

   For those of you that have never created Matroska files, visit the [19]Matroska website to find the
   right software for your platform. If you’re using Ubuntu Linux, install the mkvtoolnix package from
   the repositories. It contains all the tools you need to start working with MKV files.

     sudo apt-get-install mkvtoolnix

   The easiest method of creating your chapter definitions is with any text editor, using the following
   format. Feel free to change the name and time values accordingly. Save the file anywhere you can
   remember, e.g. chapter.txt.

     CHAPTER01=00:00:00.000
     CHAPTER01NAME=Chapter 01
     CHAPTER02=00:05:00.000
     CHAPTER02NAME=Chapter 02
     CHAPTER03=00:10:00.000
     CHAPTER03NAME=Chapter 03
     CHAPTER04=00:15:00.000
     CHAPTER04NAME=Chapter 04
     CHAPTER05=00:20:00.000
     CHAPTER05NAME=Chapter 05

   If you want to create a chapter file from an existing DVD, dvdxchap is a great tool for the job if
   you’re using Linux. It’s part of the ogmtools package. For more info, check out the [20]OGMtools
   project web site.

   Installation and three examples of how to use the tool are below.

     sudo apt-get install ogmtools

     dvdxchap /dev/dvd > chapter.txt
     dvdxchap ./VIDEO_TS/ > chapter.txt
     dvdxchap video.iso > chapter.txt

   mkvmerge is the only tool you need to create an MKV file. In the following examples, your source
   video file is called video.avi, and your destination file is video.mkv.

   A simplified version of the mkvmerge syntax is as follows.

     mkvmerge video.avi --chapters chapter.txt -o video.mkv

   I typically like to set my default language to English, and also turn off header compression for all
   tracks since some players don’t play nicely with compression enabled. The syntax and example output
   is displayed below.

     mkvmerge video.avi --default-language eng
     --compression -1:none --chapters chapter.txt -o video.mkv
     mkvmerge v4.2.0 ('No Talking') built on Jul 28 2010 16:47:39
     'video.avi': Using the AVI demultiplexer. Opening file. This may take some time depending on the
     file's size.
     'video.avi' track 0: Using the MPEG-4 part 2 video output module.
     'video.avi' track 1: Using the MPEG audio output module.
     The file 'video.mkv' has been opened for writing.
     'video.avi' track 0: Extracted the aspect ratio information from the MPEG4 layer 2 video data and
     set the display dimensions to 712/416.
     Progress: 100%
     The cue entries (the index) are being written...
     Muxing took 30 seconds.

   That’s really all there is to it. Now any media player that supports MKV chapters will allow you to
   navigate them. My favorites are VLC, Mplayer, and my Western Digital media player, the WD TV Live
   Plus.

   Verify the contents of your MKV using mkvmerge or mkvinfo.

     mkvmerge -i video.mkv
     File 'video.mkv': container: Matroska
     Track ID 1: video (V_MS/VFW/FOURCC, XVID)
     Track ID 2: audio (A_MPEG/L3)

[30]DVD to XviD Encoding with Mencoder

   Posted by admin on September 19, 2012 under [31]Tech Tips | [32]2 Comments to Read

   If you would like to copy a DVD to an XviD video file using Linux, doing so from the command line
   offers a number of flexibility benefits over many graphical tools. Two fantastic tools for the job
   are lsdvd and mencoder. I like lsdvd because it provides a great deal of information in an easy to
   read format, and mencoder is just a phenomenal tool for multimedia encoding.

   There are some pre-requisite applications you need in order to follow along. Be sure to install
   mplayer, mencoder, lsdvd, lame, and if your DVD’s are encrypted, the libdvdcss2 libraries. If using
   Ubuntu, Debian, etc, then all are available in the repositories, except libdvdcss2 which is available
   in the [33]Medibuntu repositories.

   Quick XviD Encoding Examples (For the Impatient)

   In the following examples, we’ll use mencoder with the most basic of options, allowing mencoder to
   decide which video and audio streams to use. Mencoder’s choice may not be what you want, and the
   audio will also be converted to a high quality VBR stereo MP3. Adjust any settings as you see fit.

   Single-Pass Encoding

   Fixed Quantizer Value of 4 (Good quality, decent file size)

     mencoder dvd:// -oac mp3lame -lameopts q=0:aq=0
     -ovc xvid -xvidencopts fixed_quant=4:autoaspect -o video.avi

   Fixed Quantizer Value of 2 (High quality, larger file size)

     mencoder dvd:// -oac mp3lame -lameopts q=0:aq=0
     -ovc xvid -xvidencopts fixed_quant=2:autoaspect -o video.avi

   Two Pass Encoding

   Pass 1: (no need for audio or quality settings such as bitrate)

     mencoder dvd:// -nosound -passlogfile pass1.log
     -ovc xvid -xvidencopts pass=1:turbo:autoaspect -o /dev/null

   Pass 2 Option 1: (VBR ~ 1500 kbps)

     mencoder dvd:// -oac mp3lame -lameopts q=0:aq=0 -passlogfile pass1.log
     -ovc xvid -xvidencopts pass=2:autoaspect:bitrate=1500 -o video.avi

   Pass 2 Option 2: (VBR ~ Restrict final video size to 1.5 Gb)

     mencoder dvd:// -oac mp3lame -lameopts q=0:aq=0 -passlogfile pass1.log
     -ovc xvid -xvidencopts pass=2:autoaspect:bitrate=-1500000 -o video.avi

   Basic Source Selection Examples

   If you are copying a DVD directly from a physical disc as the examples throughout this post will
   assume, the following two examples will work. The first automatically selects title 1, and the second
   specifies title 2.

     mencoder dvd:// (other options)
     mencoder dvd://2 (other options)

   If you’re encoding a DVD from an ISO or similar image file, or have the contents of a DVD extracted
   to directory, use the -dvd-device option as shown below.

     mencoder dvd:// -dvd-device video.iso (other options)
     mencoder dvd:// -dvd-device /path/to/dvd_directory/ (other options)

   Basic Audio Examples

   To encode the selected audio stream to a high quality VBR stereo MP3 format.

     mencoder dvd:// -oac mp3lame -lameopts q=0:aq=0 (other options)

   If the source audio stream is encoded as AC3 or DTS 5.1 (6 Channels), you can simply copy the stream,
   but remember to specify 6 channels. The default is 2.

     mencoder dvd:// -oac copy -channels 6 (other options)

   To exclude all sound, which is useful for the first pass of a two-pass job, or if you prefer to
   multiplex the audio later, use the -nosound option.

     mencoder dvd:// -nosound (other options)

   Gathering Source Video Information for Informed Encoding Decisions

   First you should identify which DVD title tracks are available, so you can determine which one you
   want to copy. Most DVDs will place the movie as the first track, but you may not always be that
   lucky. You can use lsdvd to list the number of titles, chapters, and audio tracks on your DVD.

     lsdvd /dev/dvd
     Disc Title: DVD_TITLE
     Title: 01, Length: 01:26:08.200 Chapters: 13, Cells: 13, Audio streams: 02, Subpictures: 01
     Title: 02, Length: 00:02:01.120 Chapters: 01, Cells: 01, Audio streams: 02, Subpictures: 01
     Title: 03, Length: 00:02:26.120 Chapters: 01, Cells: 01, Audio streams: 02, Subpictures: 01
     Longest track: 01

   In the example above, we found that Title 01 is the longest at 1 hour 26 minutes, has 13 chapters and
   2 audio streams.

   Use lsdvd again to gather additional information about video properties of this specific title.

     lsdvd -v -t 1 /dev/dvd
     Disc Title: DVD_TITLE
     Title: 01, Length: 01:26:08.200 Chapters: 13, Cells: 13, Audio streams: 02, Subpictures: 01
     VTS: 01, TTN: 01, FPS: 25.00, Format: PAL, Aspect ratio: 4/3, Width: 720, Height: 576, DF: ?

   From the output above, we see that this video is in the PAL format at 25.00 frames per second and an
   aspect ratio of 4/3. Use mplayer to play this title and verify it’s the one you want.

     mplayer dvd://1

   Gathering Source Audio Information

   Use lsdvd to give you more detail on the available audio streams for the title you’re working on.

     lsdvd -a -t 1 /dev/dvd
     Disc Title: DVD_TITLE
     Title: 01, Length: 01:26:08.200 Chapters: 13, Cells: 13, Audio streams: 02, Subpictures: 01
     Audio: 1, Language: nl - Nederlands, Format: ac3, Frequency: 48000, Quantization: drc, Channels:
     2, AP: 0, Content: Undefined, Stream id: 0x80
     Audio: 2, Language: en - English, Format: ac3, Frequency: 48000, Quantization: drc, Channels: 2,
     AP: 0, Content: Undefined, Stream id: 0x81

   The output above shows that there are two audio streams, both AC3 Dolby Digital, however only the
   second one is in English. Mencoder and mplayer allow you to specify your desired audio stream by
   language as shown in the following example.

     mencoder dvd://1 -alang eng (other options)

   If your source has multiple English streams, you can specify which particular audio ID (aid) you
   want. Mplayer can be used to display all available audio identifiers of a DVD. The following command
   is a little long but it should serve you well.

     mplayer dvd://1 -identify -frames 0 -vo null 2>&1 | grep aid
     audio stream: 0 format: ac3 (stereo) language: nl aid: 128.
     audio stream: 1 format: ac3 (stereo) language: en aid: 129.

   From the output above, the English AC3 audio stream we want is identified by aid 129. It can be
   specified when using mplayer and mencoder as shown below.

     mencoder dvd://1 -aid 129 (other options)

   Advanced Single-Pass XviD Encoding

   As mentioned before, you can encode your video using a single-pass fixed quantizer mode. It may not
   be as efficient in size and quality as opposed to a two-pass method, but it can save some time and
   complexity. Here’s the more advanced encoding options I tend to use for virtually all of my XviD
   encoding jobs, coupled with the information we gathered from above. A fixed_quant value between 2 and
   4 work very well. The lower the number the higher the quality and larger the resulting file size.

     mencoder dvd://1 -alang eng -oac mp3lame -lameopts q=0:aq=0
     -ovc xvid -xvidencopts fixed_quant=4:autoaspect:max_key_interval=25:
     vhq=2:bvhq=1:trellis:hq_ac:chroma_me:chroma_opt:quant_type=mpeg
     -o video.avi

   I added a number of quality settings as discussed both in the mencoder man page and this [34]useful
   link here.

   One option that seems to lack a lot of documentation is the max_key_interval setting. It influences
   the seekability of the encoded video. By default, the max_key_interval is set to a value of 250,
   which adds an I-frame at a maximum interval of 250 frames. This equates to approximately every 10
   seconds depending on the frame rate of your source video. I like to set the value to 25 which is
   pretty low and results in a slightly larger file, but provides a seek accuracy of about 1 second.
   That’s just my preference, so feel free to change it as you wish.

   Advanced Two-Pass XviD Encoding

   Using the same advanced XviD encoding options as above, here’s what a two pass encoding job would
   look like.

     mencoder dvd:// -nosound -passlogfile pass1.log
     -ovc xvid -xvidencopts pass=1:turbo:autoaspect:vhq=0:max_key_interval=25
     -o /dev/null

     mencoder dvd:// -oac mp3lame -lameopts q=0:aq=0 -passlogfile pass1.log
     -ovc xvid -xvidencopts pass=2:autoaspect:max_key_interval=25:bitrate=1500:
     vhq=2:bvhq=1:trellis:hq_ac:chroma_me:chroma_opt:quant_type=mpeg -o video.avi

   Cropping Black Borders

   If your video source has black borders, you can crop them out to reduce the overall size of your
   video. For example, you video may resemble the following diagram.
   [35]movie uncropped

   Video with black borders



   These borders can be cropped with a video filter -vf crop=w:h:x:y where w, h, x and y are the width,
   height, x and y coordinates. To help determine which crop values are appropriate, first play your
   video with mplayer using the -vf cropdetect option, and seek through the movie to bright points of
   the movie where the black borders are clearly visible. Dark opening scenes may give you inaccurate
   edge readings.

     mencoder dvd:// -vf cropdetect
     (snipped for brevity)
     [CROP] Crop area: X: 6..711 Y: 0..575 (-vf crop=704:576:8:0).0 0
     [CROP] Crop area: X: 6..711 Y: 0..575 (-vf crop=704:576:8:0).0 0
     [CROP] Crop area: X: 6..711 Y: 0..575 (-vf crop=704:576:8:0).0 0
     [CROP] Crop area: X: 6..711 Y: 0..575 (-vf crop=704:576:8:0).0 0
     [CROP] Crop area: X: 6..711 Y: 0..575 (-vf crop=704:576:8:0).0 0

   Copy the values that mplayer displays in the background terminal as the example above shows and use
   them like the following.

     mencoder dvd:// -vf crop=704:576:8:0 (other options)

   Conclusion

   I hope this post provides you with detail that helps you with your DVD encoding endeavors. Please
   feel free to post your comments, questions and tips. If needed, I’ll adjust the post to include your
   valuable input!

[43]Convert MKV to Xvid with Mencoder

   Posted by admin on April 9, 2009 under [44]Tech Tips | [45]2 Comments to Read

   I recently wanted to convert some of my 720p and 1080p Matroska Video (MKV) files to the Xvid format
   so that I can play them on my Xbox 360 (check out [46]ushare). I really wanted to make sure that the
   video quality and Dolby Digital 5.1 audio would remain intact, and was pleased to get the job done
   with mencoder.

   In the following example, I decided to use a single pass, fixed quantizer value of 4. The audio will
   simply be copied.

     mencoder movie.mkv -channels 6 -ovc xvid -xvidencopts fixed_quant=4
     -vf harddup -oac copy -o movie.avi

   The Dolby Digital 5.1 (AC3) output was a major pain to figure out because by default, mencoder (and
   mplayer) only will select 2 audio channels. So increasing the value to 6 ensures you receive them
   all. Otherwise, you end up getting standard stereo out all channels.

   There’s a ton of options that you can use, so just be sure to read the man pages for mencoder.

   NOTE 1: This is not an exhaustive or definitive post on quality retention. This is just an easy way
   to re-encode a source video file to Xvid.

   NOTE 2: MKV is only a container file format, meaning that you store audio and video tracks within an
   MKV file, as well as a number of other data types. e.g. Subtitles, Pictures, Fonts, etc. Many times,
   these video and audio tracks may already have been encoded with a codec supported by your media
   player. You could potentially extract the appropriate audio and video tracks with mkvextract (a
   component of the mkvtoolnix package), and recombine them into a container format supported by your
   platform. This is a great option because you would not have to re-encode, saving time and quality
   loss. I’ll update with more examples later.
