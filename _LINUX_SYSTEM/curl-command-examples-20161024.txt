cURL can be used in many different and interesting ways. With this tool you can download, upload and manage
files, check your email address, or even update your status on some of the social media websites or check the
weather outside. In this article will cover five of the most useful and basic uses of the cURL tool on any
Linux VPS.

1. Check URL
One of the most common and simplest uses of cURL is typing the command itself, followed by the URL you want
to check
	curl https://domain.com

This command will display the content of the URL on your terminal

2. Save the output of the URL to a file
The output of the cURL command can be easily saved to a file by adding the -o option to the command, as shown
below
	curl -o website https://domain.com

	% Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current
	Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed
	100 41793    0 41793    0     0   275k      0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:--  2.9M

In this example, output will be save to a file named ?website? in the current working directory.

3. Download files with cURL
You can downlaod files with cURL by adding the -O option to the command. It is used for saving files on the
local server with the same names as on the remote server
	curl -O https://domain.com/file.zip

In this example, the ?file.zip? zip archive will be downloaded to the current working directory.
You can also download the file with a different name by adding the -o option to cURL.
	curl -o archive.zip https://domain.com/file.zip

This way the ?file.zip? archive will be downloaded and saved as ?archive.zip?.

cURL can be also used to download multiple files simultaneously, as shown in the example below
	curl -O https://domain.com/file.zip -O https://domain.com/file2.zip

cURL can be also used to download files securely via SSH using the following command
	curl -u user sftp://server.domain.com/path/to/file

Note that you have to use the full path of the file you want to download

4. Get HTTP header information from a website
You can easily get HTTP header information from any website you want by adding the -I option (capital ?i?) to
cURL.
	curl -I http://domain.com
		
	HTTP/1.1 200 OK
	Date: Sun, 16 Oct 2016 23:37:15 GMT
	Server: Apache/2.4.23 (Unix)
	X-Powered-By: PHP/5.6.24
	Connection: close
	Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
	
5. Access an FTP server

	curl ftp://ftp.domain.com --user username:password

cURL will connect to the FTP server and list all files and directories in user?s home directory
