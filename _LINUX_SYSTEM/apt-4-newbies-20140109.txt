[28]APT 4 Newbies

   An interesting and detailed howto on apt, first posted on [32]linux mint community
   tutorials

   Intro by [33]Wikipedia:

     The Advanced Packaging Tool, or APT, is a free user interface that works with core
     libraries to handle the installation and removal of software on the Debian GNU/Linux
     distribution and its variants. APT simplifies the process of managing software on
     Unix-like computer systems by automating the retrieval, configuration and installation
     of software packages.

   When you launch Software Manager or Update Manager or Synaptic Package Manager, you’re
   using APT via different [34]GUIs. But you can control APT even via command lines in an easy
   and quick way.

- WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW -

   To understand this tutorial you must know:
     * how to open a[35] terminal;
     * your root password;
     * what is a [36]repository;
     * how to connect your computer to the internet.

   Every first “sudo” command will be followed by a password request. Remember that when you
   type a password in terminal, you see nothing on screen.
   All command lines are wrote in “classical syntax”; they work in Mint, Ubuntu, Debian and
   other distros supporting APT. A lot of commands have this structure:

     sudo apt-get myspecificcommand

   In Mint you can use just “apt”, without “sudo” and “-get” [thanks [37]remoulder]:

     apt myspecificcommand

   Of course, for [38]security reasons, system will still ask you the root password.

- TO ADD A REPO -

   If you need a software that is not in the official list, you must add its repository to
   your software sources. To know the repository data, browse the software site.
   Let’s make an example with Ubuntu-Tweak [a kind of "Swiss Tool", partially compatible with
   Mint]. It’s not listed in the software manager.
   Browsing official site, you find the repository id is ppa:tualatrix/ppa. To add it to your
   sources, open a terminal and write this string.

     sudo add-apt-repository ppa:tualatrix/ppa

   Your system will contact the repo and import all the needed data. So, the command line to
   add a repo is

     sudo add-apt-repository ppa:your-repo/ppa

- TO UPDATE SOFTWARE LIST -

   This one is used to resynchronize the package index files from their sources.

     sudo apt-get update

   System will contact all repos to update the local index of available software. An update
   should always be performed before an “upgrade“. Please be aware that the overall progress
   meter will be incorrect as the size of the package files cannot be known in advance.

- TO UPGRADE ALL YOUR SOFTWARE -

   This one is used to install the newest versions of all packages currently installed on your
   system.

     sudo apt-get upgrade

   upgrade is used to install the newest versions of all packages currently installed on the
   system from the sources enumerated in /etc/apt/sources.list. Packages currently installed
   with new versions available are retrieved and upgraded; under no circumstances are
   currently installed packages removed, or packages not already installed retrieved and
   installed. New versions of currently installed packages that cannot be upgraded without
   changing the install status of another package will be left at their current version. An
   update must be performed first so that apt-get knows that new versions of packages are
   available.

- TO FIND THE REAL NAME OF A SOFTWARE -

   When you don’t know the complete name of a software listed in your local index you can use
   this command [even without "sudo"].

     apt-cache search mysoftware

- TO INSTALL A SOFTWARE -

   This one is easy to understand.

     sudo apt-get install mysoftware

   Do you need to install more than one software? Yes, you can.

     sudo apt-get install mysoftware-1 mysoftware-2 mysoftware-3

   All packages required by the package(s) specified for installation will also be retrieved
   and installed.

- TO UNINSTALL A SOFTWARE -

   Basic command is

     sudo apt-get remove mysoftware

   It is identical to “install” except that packages are unistalled instead.

- TO PURGE A SOFTWARE -

     sudo apt-get purge mysoftware

   It is identical to “remove” except that packages are removed and purged (any configuration
   files are deleted too).

- SPRING CLEANING -

   “clean” clears out the local repository of retrieved package files. It removes everything
   but the lock file from /var/cache/apt/archives/ and /var/cache/apt/archives/partial/.
   “autoclean” clears out the local repository of retrieved package files. The difference is
   that it only removes package files that can no longer be downloaded, and are largely
   useless. This allows a cache to be maintained over a long period without it growing out of
   control.
   “autoremove” is used to remove packages that were automatically installed to satisfy
   dependencies for some package and that are no more needed.
   You can concatenate commands with “&&“.

     sudo apt-get autoclean && sudo apt-get autoremove

- TO CALL A COW -

     apt-get moo

- MAIN REFERENCE -

     man apt-get
