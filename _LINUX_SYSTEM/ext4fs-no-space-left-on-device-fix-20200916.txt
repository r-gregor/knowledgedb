Ext4 filesystem has no space left on device? You liar!
September 15, 2020

So, you wake up one day, and find that one of your programs, starts to complainig about “No space left on device”:

Next thing (Obviously, duh?) is to see what happened, so you fire up du -h /tmp right?:

$ du -h /tmp
Filesystem              Size    Used    Avail   Use%    Mounted on
/dev/mapper/zkvm1-root  6.2G    4.6G    1.3G    79%     /

Well, yes, but no, ok? ok, ok!
Wait, what? there's space there! How can it be? In all my years of experience (+15!), I've never seen such thing!

Gods must be crazy!? or is it a 2020 thing?
$> touch /tmp
touch: cannot touch '/tmp/test': No space left on device

Wait, what? not even a small empty file? Ok...

After shamelessly googling/duckducking/searching, I ended up at
https://blog.merovius.de/2013/10/20/ext4-mysterious-no-space-left-on.html but alas, that was not my problem,
although... perhaps too many files?, let's check with du -i this time:
$> du -i /tmp
Filesystem              Inodes      IUsed   IFree   IUse%     Mounted on
/dev/mapper/zkvm1-root  417792      417792  0       100%      /

Of course!
Because I'm super smart I'm not, I now know where my problem is, too many files!, time to start fixing this...

After few minutes of deleting files, moving things around, bind mounting things, I landed with the actual
root cause:

Tons of messages waiting in /var/spool/clientmqueue to be processed, I decided to delete some, after all,
I don't care about this system's mails... so find /var/spool/clientmqueue -type f -delete does the job, and
allows me to have tab completion again! YAY!.

However, because deleting files blindly is never a good solution, I ended up in the link from above, the
solution was quite simple:

$> systemctl enable --now sendmail

Smart idea!
After a while, root user started to receive system mail, and I could delete them afterwards :)

In the end, very simple solution (In my case!) rather than formatting or transfering all the data to a second
drive, formatting & playing with inode size and stuff...

Filesystem             Inodes   IUsed   IFree   IUse%   Mounted on
/dev/mapper/zkvm1-root 417792   92955   324837  23%     /

Et voila, ma cherie! It's alive!

This is a very long post, just to say:
ext4 no space left on device can mean: You have no space left, or you don't have more room to store your files.
