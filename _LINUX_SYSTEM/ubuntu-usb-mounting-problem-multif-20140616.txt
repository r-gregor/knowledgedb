USB flash drive mount issue

   I have a 4GB USB flash drive, which used to work fine. Recently, though, my mother had a
   problem with her HP winXP laptop. She tried to re-install XP using a Dell recovery disk,
   which would not recognize her laptop's HDD and tried to install onto my USB drive, which
   was plugged in at the time. She has a new laptop now, but my drive doesn't work: Ubuntu
   will not recognize it, and Windows only recognizes it but can't mount or partition it. What
   should I do?

   First open a terminal with Alt-Ctl-T.

   Enter the command:
mount

   and make a list of which devices are in use.

   Enter the following command to keep an eye on the syslog (log of what is happening on your
   system from the operating system point of view).
tail -f /var/log/syslog

   Now plug in and remove the flash drive. Make sure of what device it is, and that it's not
   one of the ones you saw mounted above. It may be something like /dev/sdc. Also see if you
   see the same device with a number after it, e.g. /dev/sdc1. If you see that your flash
   drive is being seen by your system.

   Assuming it is not you can format the drive. If /dev/sdm was the drive your flash drive
   becomes, plug it in once again and enter:
sudo fdisk /dev/sdm

   Now you can partition the device and format those partitions as you desire.

   If nothing is noted on /var/log/syslog as you plug in the drive and unplug it, it is,
   indeed, unusable with Ubuntu.

   I keep on coming across USB drives that can not be mounted or the partition table
   re-configured. These are commercially formatted devices that worked fine out of the box but
   fail completely after adjustments are made to the partition table. In many cases they work
   with Windows, but cannot be mounted or successfully formatted under Linux. I come across
   this most often when trying to make a LiveUSB boot device and the Ubuntu startup disk
   creator fails with a cryptic error message.

   The solution is to forcefully remove the partition table by writing zeros to the device.
   This can be achieved using dd with the following:
dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdx bs=512 count=1

   Where the USB drive in question is /dev/sdx Do not run this on any drive containing data
   because it will effectively wipe it - you need to be 100% sure that you are operating on
   the correct device.

   Once the partition table has been removed in this way you can make the partition table and
   partition the device using any program such as Disk Utility, fdisk, cfdisk etc. Note that
   "make the partition table" is an extra step that will need to be done before the device can
   be partitioned, and the correct format for this will be "msdos". You can then make ext2/4
   or any other type of partition.

   I can recommend Disk Utility as a program that is easy to use, and cfdisk is a quality
   Linux utility that is menu driven.

1. Find what the drive is called

   You'll need to know what the drive is called to mount it. To do that fire off:
sudo fdisk -l

   You're looking for a partition that should look something like: /dev/sdb1. Remember what
   it's called.

2. Create a mount point

   Create a new directory in /media so you can mount the drive onto the filesystem:
sudo  mkdir /media/usb

3. Mount!

sudo mount /dev/sdb1 /media/usb

   When you're done, just fire off:
sudo umount /media/usb

   mount: you must specify the filesystem type -  [65]Cyle May 5 at 17:41

   In addition to using the standard mount command (which requires root) you can mount drives
   using udisks and dbus with your standard user.

   To do this it is useful (but not required) to know a few things about the drive first:
    1. What device it is (i.e. /dev/sdb1)
    2. what filesystem it uses.

   Knowing these you can use a simple command to mount a drive from the command line.
gdbus call --system --dest org.freedesktop.UDisks --object-path /org/freedesktop/UDisks/devices/<dev
ice> --method org.freedesktop.UDisks.Device.FilesystemMount "<filesystem>" []

   this call should echo the path it is mounted at if the mount succeeds.

   To unmount drives mounted in this way you can run:
gdbus call --system --dest org.freedesktop.UDisks --object-path /org/freedesktop/UDisks/devices/<dev
ice> --method org.freedesktop.UDisks.Device.FilesystemUnmount []
     ______________________________________________________________________________________

   N.B. the <device> is simply the end of the path to it. So for example if what you want to
   mount is at /dev/sdb2 then you would put sdb2 in place of <device>.
     ______________________________________________________________________________________

   If you do not know which device it is or what filesystem it uses do not fear. You can
   easily print out all that information with this little command:
gdbus introspect --system --dest org.freedesktop.UDisks --object-path /org/freedesktop/UDisks/device
s --recurse --only-properties | grep -E "(readonly .+ (IdLabel|IdType|Device(IsMounted|IsDrive|File)
 ).*|\}|.*\{)"

   This will print out something like this:
node /org/freedesktop/UDisks/devices {
  node /org/freedesktop/UDisks/devices/sda {
    interface org.freedesktop.UDisks.Device {
        readonly s IdLabel = '';
        readonly s IdType = '';
        readonly s IdUsage = '';
        readonly b DeviceIsMounted = false;
        readonly s DeviceFile = '/dev/sda';
    };
  };
  node /org/freedesktop/UDisks/devices/sda1 {

  node /org/freedesktop/UDisks/devices/sda6 {
    interface org.freedesktop.UDisks.Device {
        readonly s IdLabel = '';
        readonly s IdType = 'swap';
        readonly s IdUsage = 'other';
        readonly b DeviceIsMounted = false;
        readonly s DeviceFile = '/dev/sda6';
    };
  };
  node /org/freedesktop/UDisks/devices/sda7 {
    interface org.freedesktop.UDisks.Device {
        readonly s IdLabel = '';

        readonly s IdUsage = 'filesystem';
        readonly b DeviceIsMounted = true;
        readonly s DeviceFile = '/dev/sda7';
    };
  };
  node /org/freedesktop/UDisks/devices/sdb {
    interface org.freedesktop.UDisks.Device {
        readonly s IdLabel = '';
        readonly s IdType = '';
        readonly s IdUsage = '';
        readonly b DeviceIsMounted = false;
        readonly s DeviceFile = '/dev/sdb';
    };
  };
  node /org/freedesktop/UDisks/devices/sdb1 {
    interface org.freedesktop.UDisks.Device {
        readonly s IdLabel = 'USB DRIVE';
        readonly s IdType = 'vfat';
        readonly s IdUsage = 'filesystem';
        readonly b DeviceIsMounted = false;
        readonly s DeviceFile = '/dev/sdb1';
    };
  };
  node /org/freedesktop/UDisks/devices/sr0 {
    interface org.freedesktop.UDisks.Device {
        readonly s IdLabel = '';
        readonly s IdType = '';
        readonly s IdUsage = '';
        readonly b DeviceIsMounted = false;
        readonly s DeviceFile = '/dev/sr0';
    };
  };
};

   Those that have IdUsage = 'filesystem' may be mounted using the above command.

   This means that, for example, if i wanted to mount the device 'USB DRIVE' i would run the
   command
gdbus call --system --dest org.freedesktop.UDisks --object-path /org/freedesktop/UDisks/devices/sdb1
 --method org.freedesktop.UDisks.Device.FilesystemMount "vfat" []
     ______________________________________________________________________________________

   These commands all work using the dbus messaging system, the same way that Nautilus and
   other file managers auto-mount things. In these commands we are sending various objects
   (i.e. /org/freedesktop/... messages asking them to mount and unmount certain devices. They
   might or might not do this depending on the permissions one has been given in PolicyKit.

   Using similar commands one can control almost every aspect of ones experience in Ubuntu and
   simulate most system programs and functions (i.e. shutdown, volume change, etc.).

   That's simple. When I want to use a usb drive in terminal I do this:

   Create a folder in /media with:
mkdir /media/mountDrive

   This folder will be used for the mount point. Use this command:
sudo mount /dev/sdd1 /media/mountDrive

   sdd1 is the first partition of my USB. Then you can navigate to folder you already mounted
   with
cd /media/mountDrive

   If you want to list the files in drive you can use the ls command.

   To unmount the drive you can use
sudo umount /dev/sdd1

   Note that in my system the usb drive is /dev/sdd1, but in your system it may be something
   different. To find out what it is use the df command to see all disks connected at the
   present time.

   I followed ur instructions and I mounted USB but the thing is that when i navigate to my
   USB through Terminal and do LS it shows nothing. Mount Drive name = MD -  [75]OmiPenguin
   Sep 1 '12 at 8:14

   Well I found a way. I just simply navigate to /Media folder and USB Folder was already
   available. My named my USB as a PENDRIVE so the complete path is /media/PENDRIVE And then I
   did ls and files appeared in Terminal. -  [76]OmiPenguin Sep 2 '12 at 19:36

   Install pmount, and mount a disk in /media/ like this:
pmount /dev/sdb1

   Replace "sdb1" with your specific device path. For more information see the manpage:
pmount  ("policy mount") is a wrapper around the standard mount program
which permits normal users to mount removable devices without a  match-
ing /etc/fstab entry.

pmount is invoked like this:

pmount device [ label ]

This  will  mount  device  to a directory below /media if policy is met
(see below). If label is given, the mount point will  be  /media/label,
otherwise it will be /media/device.

   To unmount, use pumount.
pumount /dev/sdb1

   I have a 1 gb flash drive that mounts fine on one machine and not on the other. Both

   manually because the drive does not show up in sudo fdisk -l.

   i had a problem a little bit like that, For a quick fix if your laptop/pc has more then one
   USB port try it in a different one because on one of my computers i could only plug it in
   twice per usb port. Also you can check out this link

   that might help your mount it. Good luck and hope this helps (sorry if it doesn't)

   USB device filesystem might be in the error state so int can't be recognized by lsusb and
   can't be mounted.
   Insert your USB flash drive on the Ubuntu machine that can properly recognize and mount it,
   then unmount it properly. Pull the USB flash drive and test in on the other system.

   on a terminal try
   $ tail -f /var/log/messages
   before inserting the flash drive. Observe what happen when you plug it in. Look for
   "sdb:sdb1" or something like this.
   It may help you if you read "sdb:sdb1" because you can mount it manually:
   $ sudo install -d /mount/flashdrive
   $ sudo mount /dev/sdb/sdb1 /mount/flashdrive
   Or it may help to findout the root of the problem.

   Not sure if this will help but it's easy and fully reversible. Try installing
   usbmount from synaptic.
   Either that or
   pmount which, combined with hal, shows an icon on the desktop automatically anytime the
   drive's plugged in.
