Ubuntu Cleanup

   [25]31 Replies
   I've recently installed Ubuntu 12.04 Long Term Support (LTS). The main advantage of a LTS
   distribution is that once you clean it up, it stays like that for two years.

   Unity

   First step is to switch your desktop to [26]LXDE, unless you like Unity or Gnome the Third.
   The recommended way is to install Lubuntu, in my case I will install LXDE on top of regular
   Unity. If you already have regular Ubuntu installed, it would be too much trouble to start
   downloading and installing everything. Also keep in mind that Lubuntu is not a LTS release,
   and the applications installed are different, for example Goolge Chromium instead of
   Mozilla Firefox, or Gnumeric instead of LibreOffice Calc. LXDE is such a small desktop
   component, it might be a better idea to chose your distro based on the applications it
   provides and switch the default desktop environment to LXDE.

     $ sudo apt-get install lxde

   Logout and login again, this time in a LXDE session and start cleaning up all the processes
   that don't make sense. Here are some of them:

   avahi

   Avahi is a [27]zeroconf implementation and a system for multicast DNS/DNS-SD service
   discovery. Its job is to assign an IP address on an interface ([28]RFC 3927) if a DHCP
   server is not present on the network, or if a static address was not configured. It allows
   you [29]to plug your laptop or computer into a network and instantly be able to view other
   people who you can chat with, find printers to print to or find files being shared.
   Right... the only reason I start my computer every day is to find files being shared on my
   local network!

   The only way to disable avahi is to modify several configuration files in /etc directory as
   follows:

   /etc/init/avahi-daemon.conf - add the word never below:
start on (never
         and filesystem
          and started dbus)
stop on stopping dbus

   /etc/network/if-up.d/avahi-autoipd - add an exit 0 as soon as the script starts
#!/bin/sh
exit 0

   /etc/network/if-up.d/avahi-daemon - add an exit 0 as soon as the script starts
#!/bin/sh
exit 0

   Zeitgeist

   Zeitgeist is a service which logs the users's activities and events, anywhere from files
   opened to websites visited and conversations - for sure is not needed on my computer.
   However, they say Gnome3 and Unity cannot function without it - piece of garbage if you are
   to ask me!

   Start by disabling the access to the database:

     $ chmod -rw ~/.local/share/zeitgeist/activity.sqlite

   Restart zeitgeist, it should fail miserably:

     $ zeitgeist-daemon ---replace
     [21:15:40.425853 WARNING] Could not access the database file.
     Please check the permissions of file /home/user/.local/share/zeitgeist/activity.sqlite.

   Purge all zeitgeist packages from the system:

     $ dpkg -l |grep zeit
     ii libzeitgeist-1.0-1 0.3.18-1ubuntu1 library to access Zeitgeist - shared library
     ii python-zeitgeist 0.9.0-1ubuntu1 event logging framework - Python bindings
     ii rhythmbox-plugin-zeitgeist 2.96-0ubuntu4.2 zeitgeist plugin for rhythmbox music
     player
     ii zeitgeist 0.9.0-1ubuntu1 event logging framework
     ii zeitgeist-core 0.9.0-1ubuntu1 event logging framework - engine
     ii zeitgeist-datahub 0.8.2-1ubuntu2 event logging framework - passive logging daemon

     $ sudo apt-get purge libzeitgeist-1.0-1 python-zeitgeist rhythmbox-plugin-zeitgeist
     zeitgeist zeitgeist-core zeitgeist-datahub

   ubuntuone-syncd

   Ubuntu One is a file syncing service similar to Dropbox. It takes a lot of RAM memory and
   generates a lot of traffic on the network. Even if you didn't sign up for the service, the
   thing is still loaded and running. Get rid of it if you don't really need it.

   Do a dpkg -l | grep ubuntuone and purge all ubuntuone packages from the system.

     $ sudo apt-get purge gir1.2-ubuntuoneui-3.0 libubuntuoneui-3.0-1 python-ubuntuone-client
     python-ubuntuone-control-panel python-ubuntuone-storageprotocol rhythmbox-ubuntuone
     ubuntuone-client ubuntuone-client-gnome ubuntuone-control-panel ubuntuone-couch
     ubuntuone-installer

   Also, remove the storage in the local directory:

     $ rm -fr ~/.local/share/ubuntuone ~/.config/ubuntuone ~/.cache/ubuntuone/

   Like all the other processes discussed here, ubuntuone-syncd will be gone after the next
   reboot.

   whoopsie

   This is Ubuntu error reporting daemon. It also takes a lot of RAM memory, and occasionally
   crashes trying to send reports to Canonical.

     $ sudo apt-get purge whoopsie

   cupsd

   The good old UNIX printing service - if you are not using a printer, just remove it.

     $ sudo apt-get purge cups

   modem-manager

   Probably my desktop weights more than 20lb, not to mention the monitor, the desk and the
   chair. It is not a mobile station, why should I run modem-manager? If there is a remote use
   case for something, you can depend on Canonical to enable it by default.

     $ sudo apt-get purge modemmanager

   bluetoothd

   Looking through my process list with ps aux I run into bluetoothd. Unfortunately I don't
   have one of those wireless keyboards/mouse and I don't really care about synchronizing
   portables, so off it goes:

     $ sudo apt-get purge gnome-bluetooth

   You also need to edit /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf and add a blacklist bluetooth at the
   end of the file
blacklist amd76x_edac
blacklist bluetooth

   colord

   colord is a system daemon that manages device color profiles, whatever that is... I mean it
   was... Just to help you make up your mind regarding removing colord, this is what the
   [30]urban dictionary has to say about "I mean":

     Meaningless American use of the English language. Often reflective of a complete lack of
     content in what they are saying - people of average intellect, articulation and
     education will simply pause and think about what they are saying. Probably due to
     American television with programs such as "Clueless", "Legally Blonde" and "the OC",
     which depict successful people as not requiring any form of intelligence or decent
     command of the English language. In real life, these people look stupid, act stupid, and
     everyone thinks they are stupid. Typically, they fail intelligence tests.

   You've been warned!

     $ sudo apt-get purge colord

   deja-dup-monitor

   Dej`a Dup is a very powerful backup tool included with Ubuntu. All things powerful consume
   memory and lots of CPU cycles. If you are like me and never do a backup, you can lose it.

     $ sudo apt-get purge deja-dup

   getty

   getty process runs on text-mode consoles and waits for someone to log in. It then
   configures the tty device and spawns a login shell. In my Ubuntu box there are 6 of them
   waiting for a login that will never happen - as I said earlier, I am running LXDE. I would
   keep however two of them, just in case...

   getty is controlled by tty*.conf files in /etc/init directory. Keep tty1.conf and tty2.conf
   in /etc/init and move tty3.conf, tty4.conf, tty5.conf and tty6.conf in some safe place
   outside /etc directory. In case you ever need them, you just move them back.

   update-notifier

   You definitely don't need this. It will bug you daily to update your software while holding
   a lot of memory hostage and doing absolutely nothing. What's next, a
   do-your-homework-notifier?

     $ sudo apt-get purge update-notifier

   You are the boss, so you do updates manually whenever you feel like it.

     sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade
     .

   acpid

   acpid deals with such events as closing a notebook lid, removing power supplies, phone
   jacks etc. It doesn't make sense to run it on a desktop.

     $ sudo apt-get purge acpid

   Java

   This is an ongoing security nightmare, this is how you get rid of it:

     $ sudo apt-get purge openjdk-\* icedtea-\* icedtea6-\*

   Xapian

   Another useless piece of functionality. You can find more about it [31]here and [32]here.
   The bug was opened a few years ago in Lubuntu, and it is still waiting for the "big guns"
   to decide what to do about it. Until they fix it, if they ever do, just

     $ sudo apt-get purge apt-xapian-index

   Conclusion

   After years of running Gentoo and Fedora, switching to Ubuntu is shocking. The desktop is
   cluttered with Canonical branding and marketing software, it is comparably slower, and some
   [33]people say it lacks privacy. It doesn't have to be this way, you can always remove the
   annoying Canonical bits starting with Unity.

   On my desktop - 64bit AMD dual core - once everything was removed, free command is
   reporting 159MB memory in use after startup. I can probably get 15MB less if I scrap
   NetworkManager and just start dhclient manually from /etc/rc.local.

   The surprise is that a similarly pruned Fedora 17 system was starting at 210MB, quite a lot
   compared to Ubuntu. I would definitely recommend Ubuntu over Fedora any time. The only
   problem is that you have to clean it a little, as every existing obscure open-source
   functionality is started by default.

       Can you please explain why installing LXDE on top of Unity is "much better
       memory-wise". Would a bunch of binaries related to Gnome3 lay around costing more
       resources than starting from LXDE from the ground up?

            an existing Unity desktop, without going through the trouble of a full reinstall.

       Thanks for writing this; I like to have a relatively clean system, but there seems a
       common lack of interest in the Linux community. The Zeitgeist bit is particularly
       annoying and dubious. Why something like Zeitgeist would ever end up in Linux is
       mysterious. And it seems the whole system is dependent on it. I fear if the slanted
       beak of Ubuntu is removed, not a penguin, but an orca is revealed. Amazon and
       Zeitgeist, hurray! Maybe sMART Boot has at least one purpose after all.

            Yes, Zeitgeist is a disgrace. It seems to be tracking webpages, documents,
            commands. It could have something to do with Amazon.

                 However, lubuntu 12.04 isn't an LTS :-(
                 ([77]http://lubuntu.net/blog/lubuntu-1204-now-available)
                 Anyway, I'm not sure if replacing Unity with LXDE on Ubuntu 12.04 voids the
                 LTS
              2. [78]netblue30 Post author[79]February 17, 2013 at 12:05 pm
                 Good point! Like many other people I've just assumed all 12.04 variants are
                 LTS.
                 Probably it will not void LTS. LXDE is just another package in the database,
                 like emacs or ssh server.

       Thanks for the handy list of things you don't need in Ubuntu. I've been running Linux
       Mint 13 Xfce for over 6 months now, and I had already used a less refined, but easier,
       method of doing away with most of them other than CUPS. First, because I use a verbose
       boot sequence, I had noticed a whole slew of modem drivers being loaded. I removed
       modem-manager and that was the end of them. I also removed zeitgeist and a few other
       things I don't need. Mint departs from Ubuntu in not installing ubuntuone or whoopsie
       or maybe both of them; in any case, I don't remember whether I removed one of them but
       by now I don't have either of them installed. After reading your article I checked and
       found that I still had avahi, although I think I had disabled it, so I removed
       avahi-utils, avahi-autoipd, and a few other avahi files. I had read about the getty
       issue before, so I have most of the files renamed to ttybak#.conf, which I understand
       disables them just as well as moving them to another directory. (Please let me know if
       it doesn't.)
       For anyone with even less real knowledge of Linux than I have, I'll explain what I mean
       by using a less refined, but easier, method of getting rid of services you don't need.
       Instead of carefully entering quite a few lines of commands in a terminal, I simply
       opened Synaptic, right-clicked on modem-manager, zeitgeist, etc., and selected "mark
       for removal" for each of them; and them clicked on the big "Apply" icon. Works for me;
       if they're not installed, they're not running. If you have very little knowledge of
       Linux, *be careful* with that approach. If you get carried away with removing things
       you think you don't need, you may end up either removing something you actually do need
       or at least removing a dependency for something else that you do need. That could
       disable your system and require a complete new install.

            This reminds me the first time I've tried to remove all cups packages, including
            libraries from a system. By the time it was done there was no X11 left and the
            computer wouldn't boot. Synaptic is a nicer way to clean it up, but you can get
            carried away as easy as in command line.

                 You don't necessarily have to remove CUPS, you can just disable the daemon.
                 True, you lose some disk space for having it installed, but if it doesn't it
                 won't bother you that much :)

       Why not simply start with Lubuntu, and save yourself a bunch of time and effort. Why
       some of you newbies don't just do some simple research is beyond me.

       Something I remove is `pastebinit'. Allows for applications to directly upload to a
       pastebin service without permission or notification. Only discovered it after
       installing boot-repair which uploaded my boot config to `Ubuntu pastebin'. Applications
       should notify you and ask for permission first and there should be a option to turn it
       off.

            boot-repair is not in the official repositories but from what I remember, there is
            a clear warning that some data is sent to pastebin. Also, IIRC, you can disable
            this behaviour.
            Be careful when you install software from 3rd party repositories!
            Don't blame the developers! It's your fault because you don't check what you
            install and don't read the on-screen instructions.

                 There is no warning when installing it (boot-repair_3.197~ppa32~precise) that
                 I can find, there is nothing in the deb package description and certainly no
                 warning when installing it through synaptic, dpkg or apt-get.
                 And there is no way to disable this `behavior' in
                 boot-repair_3.197~ppa32~precise, the only way to disable the pastebin
                 intergration is by disabling your internet connection or by NOT installing
                 gawk and pastebinit (if its not already installed). Boot-repair will ask if
                 you would like to install them for you but doesn't explain why they are
                 needed or what will happen if you do, again failing to make the user aware.
                 If those packages are already installed then boot-repair automatically sends
                 the data to `Ubuntu Pastebin' without notifying the user which is not good
                 enough. Including a users name in the final report (example: gvfs-fuse-daemon
                 on /home/bill/.gvfs type fuse.gvfs-fuse-daemon (rw,nosuid,nodev,user=bill) on
                 a public viewable webpage makes it even worse imo. That info should not be
                 included in the first place.
                 If you don't have an internet connection or you don't install the extra
                 packages then it defaults to a text file which is all that is needed anyway
                 so why pastebin in the first place?
                 Please don't start the `Don't blame the developers' nonsense, its very sloppy
                 coding at best. At worse? Well you could imagine. All that would be needed it
                 to give the user a choice of two buttons once the report has been generated,
                 one to `view as a text file' and the other `send to pastebin', a simple
                 diolog, very easy to do.
                 Btw, pastebinit installed by default in xubuntu 12.04 and boot-repair will be
                 `should be soon included in Ubuntu official repositories'. Hopefully by then
                 privacy conserns will be addressed.
                 Regardless, since we don't have application level firewalls its certainly
                 something to watch out for.

       I like this post, and I want more. It is really hard to know what all the obscure
       processes that are running are about, and what things depend on them, and if they
       are useful at all. (Why is this the case?)
       In particular, I'd like to know how to discard unity after I install LXDE, and
       I'd like to know how to get a "login" screen that defaults to LXDE, instead of
       making me click an obscure icon and make a selection. And I'd
       like to know how to talk to grub2 and tell it to show the syslog postings
       and not show a splash-screen at boot-up.

            Thanks. Your login screen will remain set to LXDE once you login in LXDE and shut
            down the computer. It remembers your last login.
            Don't bother to discard Unity, leave it there on the hard disk. It doesn't take
            too much memory. Unity is a very complex system, if you remove the wrong packet or
            the wrong library you won't be able to start your computer again. Best thing is to
            ignore it.
            I remember from my Fedora time, if you pres Esc key after the bootsplash appeared,
            the system will go immediately in text mode (with the messages you mention for
            syslog). It should be something similar here also.
