apt 1.0
APT 1.0 was released on the 1. April 2014 [0]!
The first APT version was announced on the 1. April exactly 16 years ago [1].

The big news for this version is that we included a new “apt” binary that combines the most commonly used
commands from apt-get and apt-cache. The commands are the same as their apt-get/apt-cache counterparts but
with slightly different configuration options.

Currently the apt binary supports the following commands:

list: which is similar to dpkg list and can be used with flags like
--installed or --upgradable.

search: works just like apt-cache search but sorted alphabetically.

show: works like apt-cache show but hide some details that people are less likely to care about
(like the hashes). The full record is still available via apt-cache show of course.

update: just like the regular apt-get update with color output enabled.

install,remove: adds progress output during the dpkg run.

upgrade: the same as apt-get dist-upgrade –with-new-pkgs.

full-upgrade: a more meaningful name for dist-upgrade.

edit-sources: edit sources.list using $EDITOR.

You can enable/disable the install progress via:

# echo 'Dpkg::Progress-Fancy "1";' > /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/99progressbar
If you have further suggestions or bugreport about APT, get in touch and most importantly, have fun!
