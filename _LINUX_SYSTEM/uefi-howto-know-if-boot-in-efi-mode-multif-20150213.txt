[25]How to know if I'm booting using UEFI

   I was searching, but didn't found an obvious way to know if GRUB is using UEFI in the
   system boot, or the BIOS compatibility mode or a full fledged BIOS. Only [27]Windows
   methods. Is there something in GRUB or the Kernel boot logs that shows if I'm using UEFI,
   EFI or BIOS?

   Don't have the time to look up the answer, but I've been doing a lot of UEFI
   troubleshooting lately, too. This site is pretty helpful with understanding UEFI.

   I don't mean to sound smarmy, but what's the machine's firmware set to do? –  [38]ericx Aug

   @ericx this question is under the pretense that you don't have any idea of how to check it
   out. That's why all solutions can be done on a booted system. –  [39]Braiam Nov 10 '14 at

   First method:

   Ok, I booted up my UEFI box to check. First clue, near the top of dmesg. This shouldn't
   appear if you're booted via BIOS:
[    0.000000] efi: EFI v2.31 by American Megatrends
[    0.000000] efi:  ACPI=0xd8769000  ACPI 2.0=0xd8769000  SMBIOS=0xd96d4a98
[    0.000000] efi: mem00: type=6, attr=0x800000000000000f, range=[0x0000000000000000-0x000000000000
1000) (0MB)
⋮

   Second method:
$ sudo efibootmgr
BootCurrent: 0000
Timeout: 0 seconds
BootOrder: 0000
Boot0000* debian

   If you are not, then the following should appear:
$ sudo efibootmgr

EFI variables are not supported on this system.

   Note that you'll have to have the efibootmgr package installed. You can also attempt to
   list the EFI variables:
$ efivar -l
... over 100 lines of output ...

   Third method:

   Check if you have a /boot/efi:
$ df -h --local | grep /boot
/dev/sda2       229M   31M  187M  14% /boot
/dev/sda1       120M  250K  119M   1% /boot/efi

   Inside that partition should be the files that UEFI executes to boot.

   If using any of these methods the relevant entries doesn't appear, is very likely you are
   not using UEFI.

   /boot/efi is just some directory in /boot and the rest are installed packages - all would
   likely exist on a system that was installed in UEFI mode, but is now booted with the
   compatibility support module. Still, the first is pretty sure-fire... You can disable the
   mount of the efivarfs with some kind of paranoid option. –  [47]mikeserv Aug 4 '14 at 18:38

   If you've booted using the UEFI firmware as opposed to using BIOS firmware then your system
   should make the EFI NVRAM variables available in:
/sys/firmware/efi/vars/

   or
/sys/firmware/efi/efivars/

   When booting using a BIOS (or the BIOS emulation mode of UEFI firmware) then these
   variables aren't available.
