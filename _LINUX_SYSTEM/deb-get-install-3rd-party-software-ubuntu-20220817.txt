Easily Get 3rd-Party Software on Ubuntu With Deb-Get
June 27, 2022

   Sometimes you may want to install software applications which are not in the the official package
   repositories of your Ubuntu installation. And if you want to install these software, then you have
   to:
     * Head to their official website.
     * Add their repository to your system manually (If they provide one).
     * If they don't provide a Deb package repository, then you have to download their installation
       files (Deb, AppImages... etc) manually.
     * Install the application and then use it.

   It is not a difficult task in general. However, if you have many 3rd-party applications that you want
   to install, or if you have multiple Ubuntu installations, then this will an exhausting task.

   You will be doing the same boring steps many times.

   Luckily, Deb-get utility is here for the rescue.

Grab Software From Their Sources & Install Them
   Deb-get is a high-level software installation and management tool that works on top of the apt
   package manager to easily enable installing 3rd-party software.

   The developers of the utility have already identified a list of where most common 3rd-party
   applications are distributed, and they have simply programmed their utility to download software from
   these places and install them for you automatically, so that you don't have to do it by yourself.

   You can check that list [https://github.com/wimpysworld/deb-get#supported-software]here.

   The usage syntax is quite simple. Just like apt, you can run commands like deb-get install, deb-get
   show, deb-get search and deb-get remove.

   If the 3rd-party application you are looking for is distributed in a Deb package repository, then
   that repository will be added to your system so that you can receive updates anytime you run the apt
   upgrade command. Otherwise, you will just need to run the deb-get upgrade command to update all your
   3rd-party installed applications whenever there is a new version.

   For example, you can list the available software for installation using deb-get show, and it will
   also tell you whether the software is installed on your system or not:
mhsabbagh@fosspost:~/$ deb-get list
1password
....
nordvpn                         [ installed ]
obs-cli
obs-studio                      [ installed ]
obsidian
ocenaudio
onlyoffice-desktopeditors
openrazer-meta
opera-stable
p3x-onenote
pandoc                          [ installed ]
parsec
....
rpi-imager
rstudio
rustdesk
sejda-desktop
shutter-encoder
signal-desktop                  [ installed ]
simplenote                      [ installed ]
....

   And you can install an application like Microsoft Edge on your Ubuntu installation using the deb-get
   install command:
mhsabbagh@fosspost:~$ deb-get install microsoft-edge-stable
deb [arch=amd64] https://packages.microsoft.com/repos/edge stable main

Done.

   And then you can just run it like any application:
   deb-get 5 deb-get 5

Install Deb-get on Ubuntu
   You can easily install the Deb-get utility on your Ubuntu installation using the following commands:
$> sudo apt install curl
$> curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wimpysworld/deb-get/main/deb-get | sudo -E bash -s install deb-get

   If you are hesitant to apply the curl command (If you are concerned about the content of the script),
   then you can manually download the Deb-get Debian package from GitHub and install it on your
   system.

The Bottom Line
   Deb-get is a very nifty utility for installing many 3rd-party software applications on any Ubuntu
   installation. It removes the burden of Google'ing online for software sources for the applications
   you need to install, and makes it very easy to install these applications in just one command.

   Just make sure you run the deb-get upgrade command from time to time in order to get the latest
   versions of the software that you have installed, so that you don't end up with outdated software on
   your system.
