Dmidecode – Easy Way To Get Linux System Hardware Information
August 8, 2017

   There are plenty of tools is available in Linux to check hardware information of your Linux system.
   Most of the commands report only specific hardware components like cpu or memory or hard disk but
   Dmidecode commands alone cover most of the hardware information’s.

   Dmidecode is a tool which reads a computer’s DMI (stands for Desktop Management Interface) (some say
   SMBIOS – stands for System Management BIOS) table contents and display system hardware information in
   a human-readable format.

   This table contains a description of the system’s hardware components, as well as other useful
   information such as serial number, Manufacturer information, Release Date, and BIOS revision, etc,.,

   The DMI table doesn’t only describe what the system is currently made of, it also can report the
   possible evolutions (such as the fastest supported CPU or the maximal amount of memory supported).
   This will help you to analyze your hardware capability like whether it’s support latest application
   version or not?

   As you run it, dmidecode will try to locate the DMI table. If it succeeds, it will then parse this
   table and display a list of records which you expect.

   First, learn about DMI Types and its keywords, so that we can play nicely without any trouble
   otherwise we can’t.

   DMI Types : The SMBIOS specification defines the following DMI types.
Type    Information                     Type    Information

13      BIOS Language                   34      Management Device
14      Group Associations              35      Management Device Component

19      Memory Array Mapped Address     40      Additional Information
20      Memory Device Mapped Address    41      Onboard Device

   Keywords can be used instead of type numbers with --type. Each keyword is equivalent to a list of
   type numbers.
