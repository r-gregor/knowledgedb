UFW: Common Firewall Rules and Commands
22, 20233

   A firewall is a security system that monitors and controls the incoming and outgoing network traffic
   based on predefined security rules. It is an essential component of any secure network, whether it is
   a personal computer or a large enterprise network.

   Uncomplicated Firewall (UFW) is a user-friendly, command-line interface for managing iptables, the
   Linux kernel's built-in firewall. Designed to be simple and easy to use, UFW helps administrators
   manage and enforce network security policies without delving into the complexities of iptables. In
   this article, we will explore common firewall rules and commands to help you get started with UFW.

Installing and Enabling UFW
   To install UFW on Debian/Ubuntu-based systems, use the following command:
sudo apt-get install ufw

   On CentOS/RHEL/Fedora-based systems, use:
$> sudo yum install ufw

   Once installed, enable UFW with:
$> sudo ufw enable

Basic UFW Commands
   Here are some basic UFW commands to help you manage your firewall:
     * sudo ufw status: Check the status of UFW (enabled or disabled) and display existing rules.
     * sudo ufw disable: Disable UFW.
     * sudo ufw reset: Reset UFW to its default settings and disable it.

Common Firewall Rules

   Here are some commonly used ufw commands:

    1. Allow or Deny Incoming Connections
       To allow incoming connections on a specific port, use:
$> sudo ufw allow [port]/[protocol]

       For example, to allow incoming connections on TCP port 80 (HTTP):
$> sudo ufw allow 80/tcp

       To deny incoming connections on a specific port, replace "allow" with "deny":
$> sudo ufw deny [port]/[protocol]

    2. Allow or Deny Outgoing Connections
       By default, UFW allows all outgoing connections. To block outgoing connections on a specific
       port, use:
$> sudo ufw deny out [port]/[protocol]

       To allow outgoing connections on a blocked port, replace "deny" with "allow":
$> sudo ufw allow out [port]/[protocol]

    3. Allow or Deny Connections from Specific IP Addresses
       To allow or deny connections from a specific IP address, use:
$> sudo ufw [allow|deny] from [IP_address] to any

       For example, to allow connections from 192.168.1.10:
$> sudo ufw allow from 192.168.1.10 to any

    4. Allow or Deny Connections to Specific IP Addresses
       To allow or deny connections to a specific IP address, use:
$> sudo ufw [allow|deny] from any to [IP_address]

       For example, to deny connections to 10.0.0.5:
$> sudo ufw deny from any to 10.0.0.5

    5. Deleting Rules
       To delete a specific rule, first run:
$> sudo ufw status numbered

       This will display a numbered list of rules. Identify the rule you want to delete and use its
       number in the following command:
$> sudo ufw delete [rule_number]

    6. Logging
       UFW can log activity to help you monitor and troubleshoot your firewall. To enable logging, use:
$> sudo ufw logging [on|off]

       Logs are stored in /var/log/ufw.log by default.

Conclusion
   UFW provides a convenient and straightforward interface for managing Linux firewalls. By using common
   commands and rules, administrators can easily configure network security policies to protect their
   systems from unauthorized access. As with any security tool, it's essential to keep UFW up-to-date
   and continually review and adjust your firewall rules to meet evolving security requirements.
