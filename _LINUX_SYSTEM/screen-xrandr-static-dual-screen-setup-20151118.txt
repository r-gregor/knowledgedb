tutorial;xrandr static dual screen setup; ati, intel os drivers

Why static? because after few xrandr uses, my os ati driver starts working no so well...
and, it helps a lot for older good wm's.
+Each monitor is initialized with is specific resolution.
- (for me) with static setup, if external monitor isn't connected at X startup, later there is some video
anomalies, when enabling external monitor with xrandr dynamically.

The trick for me, was the right names, it didn't work till, i named my devices, by names, that xrand
recognizes them.  Start xrandr, it will give you something like:

VGA-0 connected 1440x900+1280+0 (normal left inverted right x axis y axis) 410mm x 257mm
LVDS connected 1280x800+0+0 (normal left inverted right x axis y axis) 331mm x 207mm

xorg.conf:

Section "Monitor" #laptop monitor
    Identifier  "LVDS"
    Option       "PreferredMode" "1280x800"
EndSection

Section "Monitor" #external monitor
       Identifier   "VGA-0"
       Option       "DPMS"
       Option       "PreferredMode" "1440x900"
       Option       "LeftOf"  "LVDS"
       Option       "Position"      "1280 0"
EndSection

Section "Device"
        Identifier  "Card0"
    Driver      "radeon"
    VendorName  "ATI Technologies Inc"
    BoardName   "RC410 [Radeon Xpress 200M]"
    Option          "monitor-LVDS" "LVDS"
    Option          "monitor-VGA" "VGA-0"
EndSection


Section "Screen"
    Identifier "Screen0"
    Device     "Card0"
    Monitor    "LVDS" 
    SubSection "Display"
        Viewport   0 0
        Depth     24
        Virtual 2720 900
    EndSubSection
EndSection

don't forget to change "VGA-0" and "LVDS" by xrandr recognized devise names
