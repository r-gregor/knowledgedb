XDG user directories

   From freedesktop.org:

          xdg-user-dirs is a tool to help manage "well known" user directories like the desktop folder
          and the music folder. It also handles localization (i.e. translation) of the filenames.

          The way it works is that xdg-user-dirs-update(1) is run very early in the login phase.
          This program reads a configuration file, and a set of default directories. It then creates
          localized versions of these directories in the user home directory and sets up a configuration
          file in $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/user-dirs.dirs (XDG_CONFIG_HOME defaults to ~/.config) that
          applications can read to find these directories.

   Most file managers indicate XDG user directories with special icons.

Installation
   Install xdg-user-dirs.
   Note: Some desktop environments might have it installed already, e.g. GNOME.

Creating default directories
   Creating a full suite of localized default user directories within the $HOME directory can be done
   automatically by running:
$> xdg-user-dirs-update

   Tip: To force the creation of English-named directories, LC_ALL=C.UTF-8 xdg-user-dirs-update --force
   can be used.

   When executed, it will also automatically:
     * Create a local ~/.config/user-dirs.dirs configuration file: used by applications to find and use
       home directories specific to an account.
     * Create a local ~/.config/user-dirs.locale configuration file: used to set the language according
       to the locale in use.

   The user service xdg-user-dirs-update.service will also be installed and enabled by default, in order
   to keep your directories up to date by running this command at the beginning of each login session.

Creating custom directories
   Both the local ~/.config/user-dirs.dirs and global /etc/xdg/user-dirs.defaults configuration files
   use the following environmental variable format to point to user directories:
   XDG_DIRNAME_DIR="$HOME/directory_name" An example configuration file may likely look like this (these
   are all the template directories):
~/.config/user-dirs.dirs
XDG_DESKTOP_DIR="$HOME/Desktop"
XDG_DOCUMENTS_DIR="$HOME/Documents"
XDG_DOWNLOAD_DIR="$HOME/Downloads"
XDG_MUSIC_DIR="$HOME/Music"
XDG_PICTURES_DIR="$HOME/Pictures"
XDG_PUBLICSHARE_DIR="$HOME/Public"
XDG_TEMPLATES_DIR="$HOME/Templates"
XDG_VIDEOS_DIR="$HOME/Videos"

   As xdg-user-dirs will source the local configuration file to point to the appropriate user
   directories, it is therefore possible to specify custom folders. For example, if a custom folder for
   the XDG_DOWNLOAD_DIR variable has named $HOME/Internet in ~/.config/user-dirs.dirs any application
   that uses this variable will use this directory.
   Note: Like with many configuration files, local settings override global settings. It will also be
   necessary to create any new custom directories.

   Alternatively, it is also possible to specify custom folders using the command line. For example, the
   following command will produce the same results as the above configuration file edit:
$> xdg-user-dirs-update --set DOWNLOAD ~/Internet

Querying configured directories
   Once set, any user directory can be viewed with xdg-user-dirs. For example, the following command
   will show the location of the Templates directory, which of course corresponds to the
   XDG_TEMPLATES_DIR variable in the local configuration file:
$> xdg-user-dir TEMPLATES

   Warning: xdg-user-dir should not receive its argument from unchecked input, since it simply passes it
   to eval without performing any sanity checks, in a line that looks like this:
eval echo \${XDG_${1}_DIR:-$HOME}

   This means that xdg-user-dir facilitates arbitrary code execution from unsanitized input. Unless this
   unsafe implementation is fixed upstream, xdg-user-dir should only ever be used with a hard-coded or
   strictly audited argument.
