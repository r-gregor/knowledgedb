Cracking Wifi WPA/WPA2 passwords using pyrit cowpatty in Kali Linux
Wednesday, May 14, 2025

Cracking Wifi WPA/WPA2 passwords using pyrit cowpatty- with cuda or calpp in Kali Linux
   There are just too many guides on Cracking Wifi  WPA/WPA2 passwords using different methods. Everyone
   has their own take on it. Personally, I think there's no right or wrong way of cracking a Wireless
   Access Point. Following way is my way and I found it extremely efficient and fast during my tests for
   Cracking Wifi WPA/WPA2 passwords using pyrit cowpatty in Kali Linux where I attacked with Dictionary
   using either cuda or calpp (cal++) and at the same time I used WiFite to fast track a few things.
   This whole process was used in Kali Linux and it took me less than 10 minutes to crack a Wifi
   WPA/WPA2 password using pyrit cowpatty WiFite combination using my laptop running a AMD ATI 7500HD
   Graphics card.

   You can make the following process faster like I did. If you have an AMD ATI Graphics card you'll
   have to follow these guides below:

    4. [https://www.blackmoreops.com/2013/11/22/install-cal-kali-linux/]Install CAL++ in Kali Linux

   Readers: Please find the most recent article that applies to your graphics card. It's getting almost
   impossible to keep with with updates and changing links alone. Find the article with recent date.

   Readers, those who would like to try alternate ways of cracking Wifi WPA WPA2 passwords, use
   HashCat or cudaHashcat or oclHashcat to crack your unknown Wifi WPA WPA2 passwords. The benefit
   of using Hashcat is, you can create your own rule to match a pattern and do a Brute-force attack.
   This is an alternative to using dictionary attack where dictionary can contain only certain amount of
   words but a brute-force attack will allow you to test every possible combinations of given charsets.
   Hashcat can crack Wifi WPA/WPA2 passwords and you can also use it to crack MD5, phpBB, MySQL and
   SHA1 passwords. Using Hashcat is an good option as if you can guess 1 or 2 characters in a password,
   it only takes few minutes. For example: if you know 3 characters in a password, it takes 12 minutes
   to crack it. If you know 4 characters in a password, it takes 3 minutes. You can make rules to only
   try letters and numbers to crack a completely unknown password if you know a certain Router's default
   password contains only those. Possibilities of cracking is a lot higher in this way.

   Important Note: Many users try to capture with network cards that are not supported. You should
   purchase a card that supports Kali Linux including injection and monitor mode etc. A list can be
   found in Recommended USB Wireless Cards for Kali Linux. It is very important that you have
   a supported card, otherwise you'll be just wasting time and effort on something that just won't do
   the job.

Capture handshake with WiFite
   Why WiFite instead of other guides that uses Aircrack-ng? Because it's faster and we don't have to
   type in commands..

   Type in the following command in your Kali Linux terminal:
$> wifite -wpa

   You could also type in
$> wifite wpa2

   If you want to see everything, (wep, wpa or wpa2, just type the following command. It doesn't make
   any differences except few more minutes
$> wifite

   Once you type in following is what you'll see.

   pyrit-and-cowpatty-blackMORE-Ops.jpg]

   So, we can see bunch of Access Points (AP in short). Always try to go for the ones with CLIENTS
   because it's just much faster. You can choose all or pick by numbers. See screenshot below:

   [http://www.darkmoreops.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/2-Wifite-Screen-Cracking-Wifi-WPAWPA2-passwords-\
   using-pyrit-and-cowpatty-blackMORE-Ops.jpg]

   Awesome, we've got few with clients attached. I will pick 1 and 2 cause they have the best signal
   strength. Try picking the ones with good signal strength. If you pick one with poor signal, you might
   be waiting a LONG time before you capture anything .. if anything at all.

   So I've picked 1 and 2. Press Enter to let WiFite do it's magic.

   [http://www.darkmoreops.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/3-WiFite-Choice-Cracking-Wifi-WPAWPA2-passwords-\
   using-pyrit-and-cowpatty-blackMORE-Ops.jpg]

   Once you press ENTER, following is what you will see. I got impatient as the number 1 choice wasn't
   doing anything for a LONG time. So I pressed CTRL+C to quit out of it.

   This is actually a great feature of WiFite. It now asks me,

   What do you want to do?
    1. [c][/c]ontinue attacking targets
    2. [e]xit completely.

   I can type in c to continue or e to exit. This is the feature I was talking about. I typed c to
   continue. What it does, it skips choice 1 and starts attacking choice 2. This is a great feature
   cause not all routers or AP's or targets will respond to an attack the similar way. You could of
   course wait and eventually get a respond, but if you're just after ANY AP's, it just saves time.

   [http://www.darkmoreops.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/4-WiFite-continue-Cracking-Wifi-WPAWPA2-passwords-\
   using-pyrit-and-cowpatty-blackMORE-Ops.jpg]

   And voila, took it only few seconds to capture a handshake. This AP had lots of clients and I managed
   to capture a handshake.

   This handshake was saved in /root/hs/BigPond_58-98-35-E9-2B-8D.cap file.

   Once the capture is complete and there's no more AP's to attack, Wifite will just quit and you get
   your prompt back.

   passwords-using-pyrit-and-cowpatty-blackMORE-Ops.jpg]

   Now that we have a capture file with handshake on it, we can do a few things:
    1. We can Dictionary attack it.
    2. We can BruteForce attack it.
          + Amongst BruteForce, we can use crunch
          + We can use oclhashcat.

   In this guide, I will show Dictionary attack as almost 20% (that's 1 in every 5) AP's will have a
   standard dictionary password. In later chapters of this guide, I will show Brute Forcing.

Dictionary attack .cap capture file to crack Wifi password
   To do a Dictionary attack, we need to grab a dictionary file.

   Kali Linux provides some dictionary files as part of its standard installation. How sweet. Thanks
   Kali Linux Dev team.

   Let's copy one of best dictionary file to root directory.
cp /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt.gz .

   Unzip it.
$> gunzip rockyou.txt.gz

   Because WPA2 minimum password requirement is 8 characters, let's parse this file to filter out any
   passwords that is less than 8 characters and more than 63 characters. (well, you could just leave
   this line, but it is completely up to you). So we are saving this file as newrockyou.txt name.
$> cat rockyou.txt | sort | uniq | pw-inspector -m 8 -M 63 > newrockyou.txt

   Let's see how many passwords this file contains:
$> wc -l newrockyou.txt

   That's a whopping 9606665 passwords.

   Original file contained even more..
$> wc -l rockyou.txt

   That's 14344392 passwords. So we made this file shorter which means we can test more AP's in less
   time.

   Finally, lets rename this file to wpa.lst.
$> mv newrockyou.txt wpa.lst

   Wifi-WPAWPA2-passwords-using-pyrit-and-cowpatty-blackMORE-Ops.jpg]

Create ESSID in Pyrit Database
   Now we need to create ESSID in Pyrit Database.
$> pyrit -e BigPond create_essid

   NOTE: If you have an AP that's got Space it in, example: "NetComm Wireless" then your command will
   become like this:
$> pyrit -e 'NetComm Wireless' create_essid

   I know a lot of the people struggles with this issue :)

   [http://www.darkmoreops.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/7-pyrit-create-essid-Cracking-Wifi-WPAWPA2-\
   passwords-using-pyrit-and-cowpatty-blackMORE-Ops.jpg]

   Awesome, now we have our ESSID added to Pyrit Database.

Import Dictionary in Pyrit
   Now that we have our ESSID added to Pyrit database, lets go an import our Password Dictionary.

   Use the following command to import previously created password dictionary wpa.lst to Pyrit Database.
$> pyrit -i /root/cudacapture/wpa.lst import_passwords

   [http://www.darkmoreops.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/8-pyrit-import-dictionary-password-file-Cracking-\
   Wifi-WPAWPA2-passwords-using-pyrit-and-cowpatty-blackMORE-Ops.jpg]

Create tables in Pyrit using batch process
   We now need to batch process to create tables.

   This is simple, just issue the following command
$> pyrit batch

   [http://www.darkmoreops.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/9-pyrit-create-tables-using-batch-process-Cracking-\
   Wifi-WPAWPA2-passwords-using-pyrit-and-cowpatty-blackMORE-Ops.jpg]

   Because I'm on a laptop with a crappy AMD 7500 graphics card, I'm getting only 15019 PMKs per second
   (that includes my CAL++). If you got a more powerful Graphics card and managed to install either CUDA
   for NVIDIA Graphics card or CAL++ for AMD Cards, your speed will be a lot more.

   Oh, and I just took this awesome screenshot while Pyrit was doing the batch processing. Check out my
   CPU usage, it's hitting absolutely 100%.

   [http://www.darkmoreops.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/10-pyrit-100-percent-CPU-usage-Cracking-Wifi-\
   WPAWPA2-passwords-using-pyrit-and-cowpatty-blackMORE-Ops.jpg]

   Also check out my temperature of my cores:
   [http://www.darkmoreops.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/11-pyrit-high-CPU-Temperature-Cracking-Wifi-\
   WPAWPA2-passwords-using-pyrit-and-cowpatty-blackMORE-Ops.jpg]

   You should be careful how big your dictionary file is and how HOT your CPU and Graphics card is
   burning. Use extra cooling if you can to avoid damage.

Cracking Process
   We can crack using few different process.
    1. Using Pyrit
    2. Using Cowpatty

Attack a handshake with PMKs from the db using Pyrit
   Simple. Just use the following command to start the cracking process.
$> pyrit -r hs/BigPond_58-98-35-E9-2B-8D.cap attack_db

   [http://www.darkmoreops.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/21-pyrit-attack_db-Cracking-Wifi-WPAWPA2-passwords-\
   using-pyrit-and-cowpatty-blackMORE-Ops.jpg]

   That's it. It will take few minutes to go through the whole Database Table to get the password if it
   existed in the Dictionary. As you can see, 159159186.00 PMK's per second was the speed and it took
   less than 1 second to crack it. This is by far the fastest. I also had to blank out much of the
   screenshot.

   Note: I tried it from a different workstation with a NVIDIA GTX460 Graphics card with CUDA and
   Cpyrit-CUDA installed. Obviously, this was much faster than my Laptop. But either way, this is super
   fast.

Attack a handshake with passwords from a file or Dictionary using Pyrit
   If you don't want to create Datbase and crunch through Dictionary file directly (much slower),
   following is what you can do:
$> pyrit -r hs/BigPond_58-98-35-E9-2B-8D.cap -i /root/wpa.lst attack_passthrough

   Speed this way? 7807 PMKs per second. Much slower for my taste.

Crack using Cowpatty
   To crack using cowpatty, you need to export in cowpatty format and then start the cracking process.

Export to cowpatty
   I hope up to this point, everything went as planned and worked out. From Pyrit, we can push our
   output to either cowpatty or airolib-ng. All my tests shows that cowpatty is a lot more faster, so
   I'll stick with that.

   So let's make our cowpatty file. This is again simple, issue the following command to export your
   output to cowpatty.
$> pyrit -e BigPond -o cow.out export_cowpatty

   [http://www.darkmoreops.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/12-pyrit-export-to-cowpatty-Cracking-Wifi-WPAWPA2-\
   passwords-using-pyrit-and-cowpatty-blackMORE-Ops.jpg]

Let it rip: Crack WPA WPA2 PSK password using cowpatty
   Now that we have our cowpatty output, let's try to crack WPA2/PSK passphrase. Issue the following
   command to start the cracking process.
$> cowpatty -d cow.out -s BigPond -r hs/BigPond_58-98-35-E9-2B-8D.cap

   [http://www.darkmoreops.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/13-crack-wpa-wpa2-psk-password-cowpatty-Cracking-\
   Wifi-WPAWPA2-passwords-using-pyrit-and-cowpatty-blackMORE-Ops.jpg]

   Once you type it in, you'll a bunch of passwords being tried against your hash file. This will keep
   going until the end of the file. Once a matching password is found in the dictionary file, the
   cracking process will stop with an output containing the password.

   [http://www.darkmoreops.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/14-cracked-it-wpa-wpa2-psk-password-cowpatty-\
   Cracking-Wifi-WPAWPA2-passwords-using-pyrit-and-cowpatty-blackMORE-Ops.jpg]

   And bingo, it found a matching password. Look at the number of passwords tried in a seconds 164823.00
   passphrases/second.

   NOTE: cowpatty will fail if your password/dictionary file is larger than 2GB. You'll have to stick to
   airolib-ng even though that's slower.

Attack a handshake with PMKs from a cowpatty-file using Pyrit
   Here's another way using Pyrit...

   You can use cow.out file in Pyrit next time
$> pyrit -r hs/BigPond_58-98-35-E9-2B-8D.cap -i /root/cow.out attack_cowpatty

   Speed this way? 31683811 PMKs per second. Much slower than using Pyrit attack_db process. But at
   least you don't have to batch process this way.

Cleanup Pyrit and database
   Lastly, if you feel like, you can delete your essid and cleanup.
$> pyrit BigPond delete_essid

Conclusion
   Thanks for reading. This process is not always possible and sometimes cracking Wifi WPA/WPA2
   passwords using Reaver-WPS is much easier. You might want to check that too.
