Thread: ISO Booting with Grub 2

ISO Booting with Grub 2
This thread will detail how to place a menu entry in Grub 2 to allow booting an ISO file stored on your
computer without a CD/DVD. Not all ISOs will work with Grub 2. The ISO must be constructed in a manner to
allow this method of booting. Currently the Ubuntu family of Live CD ISOs (9.10 and later), Gparted CD,
Parted Live CD, and SystemRescue CD, among others, support this feature. As pointed out by Splooshie123
in Post 240, this method (as described) won't work with the Ubuntu Alternate Installation CD.

I have another thread which covers actually installing Ubuntu from an ISO booted from a Grub promtp. This
might be useful for someone who can download the ISO but can't use a CD/DVD. That thread is located here:
HOWTO: Boot & Install Ubuntu from the Grub Rescue Prompt

I have received a report from YorYor in Grub 2 Basics Post #642 that at least some image files (.img)
can also be booted by Grub 2. An example menuentry is included below.

Note 1: In addition to being able to use Grub2 to boot Ubuntu (and other) ISOs, Multisystem offers
additional capabilities which the user may find helpful in booting and testing other OS's ISOs such as
Fedora without installing the OS. Thanks to seanbw in Post #137 for calling attention to this app.

Note 2: I have written a guide on booting the Ubuntu ISO from the Grub rescue prompt in order to repair
a previously-working installation. The guide also includes instructions on how to install Ubuntu from
the rescue prompt via the Live CD ISO or via the Internet.
HOWTO: Boot & Install Ubuntu from the Grub Rescue Prompt


Being able to mount an Ubuntu ISO via the Grub menu has the following advantages:
There is no need to insert a CD/DVD.
Boot times of the CD/DVD's ISO is normally faster than booting from an actual CD/DVD.


Downloading ISOs:
Note: Users should consider using torrents to download the ISOs, especially after a new release when
servers are likely to be very busy.

Here are a few sites from which users can download bootable ISO images:
Ubuntu/Kubuntu/Edbuntu download mirrors:
http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/downloadmirrors#mirrors


If you already know the name of the server and file, you can also download it via the command line. For
instance:
Code:
wget http://ftp.ucsb.edu/pub/mirrors/linux/ubuntu/10.04/ubuntu-10.04-desktop-amd64.iso

SystemRescue CD:
http://www.sysresccd.org/Download
Notes: Opens to a command line. Type "wizard" to enable GUI. The GUI contains Firefox, terminal, gparted,
file browser, cd/dvd burning, text editor.
Gparted CD:

Notes: Screenshot, terminal, gparted. GUI.
Parted CD:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/gpar...d-live-stable/
Notes: Windows users will feel comfortable with this app. Gparted, system profiler/benchmark, PcManFM
file browser, terminal, networking.


Where to place the ISOs:
I prefer storing the ISO files on a non-system partition but for simplicity's sake in this post I will make
a new folder in the system's /boot folder called "iso". The ISO files will reside in the sda1 partition
in the /boot/iso folder. In this example, the address of the ISO, translated so Grub2 understands, is:
(hd0,1)/boot/iso/<iso_filename>

Since 'rescue CDs' such as Gparted are loaded into memory and use a self-contained version of linux, the
format of the partition does not matter as long as it is one that Grub 2 can recognize. Additionally,
the ISOs like Gparted's can be located on a system partition since the partition is not mounted. This
allows the real partition to be resized even if the ISO is located in the same partition.

The user will need to adjust the Grub menu entries to properly point to the correct partition and folder
for their own situation.


Notes on ISO locations
Separate /home folder: Many Ubuntu users have a separate HOME partition. If the ISO folder or file is
placed in your HOME folder, be sure to use the correct path in the menuentry - do not include "/home"
in the path. Since a separate /home partition is only mounted by fstab later in the boot process, Grub
2 will not find the file if the path is designated (hdX,Y)/home/username/iso/isofilename.

Non-Linux Partitions: If the ISO is stored on a non-Linux partition (NTFS, vfat, etc), the appropriate
module must be loaded to ensure Grub2 can read the filesystem. An example of an added module as the
first line below the menuentry follows. (See ny6ga's post #39 for a complete example)
menuentry "Parted Magic" {
insmod ntfs
... continued ....


The correct Grub 2 path for an ISO file normally found in /home/username/iso/isofilename would be
(hdX,Y)/username/iso/isofilename, with (hdX,Y) being the partition of the separate HOME files and username
being the user's login name.
Example: / is on sda5, /home/drs305 is on sda10. The iso file is in folder "iso" and the
filename is "maverick-desktop-i386.iso". When running Ubuntu, the file can be found at
/home/drs305/iso/maverick-desktop-i386.iso.
In Grub 2, the address would be: (hd0,10)/drs305/iso/maverick-desktop-i386


To make the new folder in which to store the ISOs:
Code:
sudo mkdir /boot/iso
Then copy the ISO file(s) as root to this new folder.
Note: If you will have your ISO's stored on another partition, be sure the partition is mounted before
copying files to the mount point.

To summarize, I have downloaded the ISOs, placed them in the /boot/iso folder of the sda1 partition. If
I did a search for the Ubuntu Lucid ISO, it would be shown in:
/boot/iso/ubuntu-10.04-desktop-i386.iso

Customizing the menuentries:
In the following examples, the user can change the title (between the quotation marks) on the menuentry
line to whatever title is desired.

The filenames reflect the current release version of the ISOs mentioned previously. As newer versions
are released the filenames will need to adjusted to reflect the newer filename.


Making the Grub 2 entry:
The following line is not necessary but provides feedback during the execution of "update-grub". It
generates a line in the terminal when updating Grub to indicate that the 40_custom file contents are
being added to the Grub2 menu:
echo "Adding 40_custom." >&2
Sample /etc/grub.d/40_custom file:

The simple way to add entries. The easiest way to incorporate ISOs into the Grub2 menu is to add them
to the /etc/grub.d/40_custom file. Leave the existing lines in 40_custom as they are, and add the new
entries below. The menu items will appear at the bottom of the Grub 2 menu. If you wish the items to
appear first, name the menu "06_custom" and make the file executable. Items in "06_custom" will appear
before linux and other OS menu items.

Manually creating the menuentry. If you create the entry manually, I recommend a slightly different
format for the menuentry. Incorporating the set isofile= line to set the path and filename of the ISO
file allows for easier troubleshooting and less confusion. It also allows the user to change only one
entry if a file's name changes (e.g. version update). I thank forum user oldfred, who showed me this
method. For entries not copied directly from the grub.cfg file:
menuentry "Lucid ISO" {
set isofile="/boot/iso/ubuntu-10.04-desktop-i386.iso"
loopback loop (hd0,1)$isofile

initrd (loop)/casper/initrd.lz
}

#!/bin/sh
echo "Adding 40_custom." >&2
exec tail -n +3 $0
# This file provides an easy way to add custom menu entries. Simply type the
# menu entries you want to add after this comment. Be careful not to change
# the 'exec tail' line above.

Run "sudo update-grub" after saving /etc/grub.d/40_custom to include the new entries into the Grub 2 menu.


Persistence:
See Post #254 by NikTh for information on making an ISO
persistent. http://ubuntuforums.org/showpost.php...&postcount=253

More ISO Menuentries:
If you need to inspect the contents of an ISO for troubleshooting purposes, you can mount it while
running a Linux OS with the following commands. You will make a mount point in /mnt and then mount the
ISO to /mnt/temp. After mounting, you can use a file browser to inspect the contents of /mnt/temp.
One example of using the mount command to inspect the contents is to check the initrd file. In bootable
Ubuntu ISOs (Karmic & later) the file is initrd.lz In some other third-party ISOs, the file may be
initrd.gz rather than initrd.lz.

Code:
sudo mkdir /mnt/temp
sudo mount -o loop /boot/iso/<filename.iso> /mnt/temp
When you are finished:
sudo umount /mnt/temp
