MBR vs GPT SSD: Which Partition Style is Better?
Wednesday, February 12, 2025

mbr vs gpt ssd differencesmbr vs gpt ssd differencesWhen you are setting up an SSD, one of the most important
questions that you face is: which is the right partition style for me? There is a decision to make: MBR vs
GPT SSD. MBR stands for Master Boot Record while GPT stands for GUID Partition table. This choice is
important because the choice you make will determine the compatibility, performance, and future expansion
options.

In this article, let us explain each partition style's advantages, limitations, use cases and most
importantly the answer to the battle: MBR vs GPT SSD.

Understanding the MBR and GPT Partition Styles

What is MBR (Master Boot Record)?
MBR is the forerunner here. It is the older partitioning scheme introduced in 1983. It stores the partition
information and the bootloader in the first sector of the storage device.

Salient Features of MBR
The MBR style of partition supports 4 primary partitions: 3 primary and 1 extended partition. This works only
in drives up to 2TB in capacity. This uses BIOS-based boot made. The chance of corruption is higher because
this style of partition is less resilient since partition data is stored in a single location.

What is GPT (GUID Partition Table)?
GPT is the modern partitioning style, and it is part of the UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface)
standard.

Salient Features of GPT
When compared to the 4 partitions in the MBR, the SSD style supports up to 128 partitions. And this partition
limit is enforced only in Windows whereas in Linux, there is no upper limit of partitions. The GPT partition
can work on drives larger than 2TB as well. This uses the UEFI based boot mode compared to the legacy BIOS
mode used by MBR. This style stores multiple copies of partition data across the disk so the chance of
corruption is minimized. This supports some advanced features like secure boot mode and also comes with
better partition error detection.

MBR vs GPT SSD: Differences Explained
Here is a comparison in table format to make your decision making easier.

==========================================================================
Description        MBR                          GPT
==========================================================================

Partition limit    4 primary partitions         128 primary partitions
Boot mode          BIOS (legacy)                UEFI
Data redundancy    No                           Yes (multiple copies)
Compatibility      Works with older versions    Requires modern versions
==========================================================================

When to Use MBR vs GPT SSD

When Should You Use MBR
Prefer MBR if:
  * You are using older operating systems that does not support UEFI
  * The SSD capacity is less than 2TB
  * You need legacy BIOS boot support

When Should You Use GPT

Your choice should be GPT if:
  * Your operating systems are modern like Windows 11 or Ubuntu latest LTS versions
  * Your SSD has capacity more than 2TB
  * You want better redundancy and data protection
  * You need an SSD type that supports more than 4 partitions

How can You Convert MBR to GPT SSD
Follow these instructions in the same sequence listed here.

How to Check Partition Type in Windows
  * Open the Disk Management window. To do this, open the Run terminal and execute "diskmgmt.msc"
  * Right-click your SSD and then select "Properties".
  * Under the "Volumes" tab, check the "Partition Style" field. The value will be either MBR or GPT.

Convert MBR to GPT in Windows
 1. Get backups of all your data.
 2. Open "Disk Management" window.
 3. Right-click the SSD and then click "Delete Volume". Double check if your backups are reliable since this
    step deletes all your data".
 4. Right-click the SSD and then select "Convert to GPT Disk".

How to Convert MBR to GPT using Command Prompt
Be very careful with this method as there are chances of data loss.
 1. Open Command Prompt as Administrator.
 2. Type "diskpart" and press the Enter key.
 3. Type "list disk" and press the Enter key to see the list of all available drives.
 4. Type "select disk ssdnumber" and press the Enter key (replace "ssdnumber" with the SSD drive's number).
 5. Execute the "clean" command. This deletes all the partitions.
 6. Execute the command "convert gpt".

Convert MBR to GPT using MBR2GPT
This method involves no threat of data loss, but we tried it only on Microsoft Windows 10 and 11 OS versions
only.
 1. Open Command Prompt as Administrator.
 2. Run the command: mbr2gpt /validate /disk:ssdnumber (replace ssdnumber with the SSD Number).
 3. Once the validation passes, run the command: mbr2gpt /convert /disk:ssdnumber

Key Takeaways
For modern SSDs, the obvious winner in the MBR vs GPT SSD battle is the GPT. GPT is the better choice when it
comes to improved partition support, data redundancy, compatibility with most UEFI based systems. That being
said, we cannot sideline MBR. It is still useful for legacy systems running on BIOS environments and smaller
than 2TB SSDs. So, the comparison of MBR vs GPT SSD comes down to your environment and requirements. Here is
a summarized version of what we learnt today:
  * MBR is for older systems and BIOS based bootloaders
  * GPT is for modern SSD, large capacity drives, and UEFI bootloaders.

We hope we have covered all topics so that you can make an informed decision to optimize SSD performance and
compatibility.

GPT or MBR: Which is Better for Your Linux Device
Wednesday, February 12, 2025

mbr or gpt differencesmbr or gpt differencesWhen you are configuring your SSD in a Linux system, one of the
most important deciding factors is selecting the correct partition style. The question boils down to GPT or
MBR? Which partition style to choose? This choice is very important because this affects the compatibility,
performance, and system stability of your device.

In this guide, let us help you make the MBR or GPT decision, advantages of the style, limitations, and the
best use cases for each type.

Understanding Each Partition Style

Let us start with the basics.

What is MBR
MBR is short for Master Boot Record. This was introduced in 1983. This stores the partition information and
the bootloader data in the first sector of the storage device.

The key features of MBR include:

  * Supports 3 primary and 1 extended partition (total 4 primary partitions).
  * Works only on SSDs up to 2TB in size.
  * Uses the legacy BIOS based bootloader function.
  * Less resistance against data corruption because the partition information is stored in a single sector.

What is GPT
GPT stands for GUID Partition Table. It is a comparatively modern partitioning format that is part of the
UEFI (unified extensible firmware interface) bootloader standard.

Here are some features that set GPT apart:

  * This supports 128 partitions in Windows and even more in Linux devices
  * This partition type can work on SSDs with more than 2TB capacity
  * Uses the UEFI based boot mode but can work with BIOS using the hybrid MBR
  * Stores multiple copies of the partition data across the SSD for better resistance against data corruption
  * Comes with secure boot and better error detection in most cases.

Major Differences: GPT or MBR

===============================================================================================
Feature                     MBR                     GPT
===============================================================================================
Supported Drive Size        2TB                     9.4ZB (zeta bytes)
Maximum partitions limit    4                       128
Boot mode                   Legacy BIOS             UEFI or BIOS (using GRUB)
Data protection             Lower                   Higher (multiple copies of partition table)
Compatibility               Works on old distros    Required for modern distros
===============================================================================================

What Should You Choose: GPT or MBR for Linux
Prefer the MBR style if:
  * Your device is running on old Linux distros that do not support UEFI yet
  * Your SSD capacity is less than 2TB
  * You need legacy BIOS boot support
  * Your system does not require more than 4 primary partitions.

Prefer the GPT style if:
  * You are using modern Linux distros like Ubuntu, Debian, Kali Linux, Amazon Linux, or SUSE.
  * Your SSD capacity is higher than 2TB.
  * You want better protection against data corruption, data integrity, and redundancy.
  * You need support for more than 4 partitions.
  * Your distribution uses UEFI boot mode.

Step by Step Instructions to Convert MBR to GPT in Linux
It is very important to follow these steps in sequence.

How to Check the Partition Type in Linux
 1. Open the Terminal window.
 2. Run the command: sudo fdisk -l
 3. Find your SSD and check if it uses MBR (mentioned as dos) or GPT (mentioned as gpt).

How to Convert MBR to GPT in Linux
Let us show you two methods to convert MBR to GPT in your Linux device.

Convert MBR to GPT Using gdisk
Install gdisk if you do not have it already. To do that, execute the command:
$> sudo apt install gdisk # For Debian and Ubuntu distros
$> sudo dnf install gdisk # For Fedora
$> sudo pacman -S gdisk # For Arch Linux

Next run the command after replacing "SSD" with your Drive identifier.
$> sudo gdisk /dev/sdSSD

Next enter "w" to write the changes and convert the disk to GPT.

How to Convert MBR to GPT Using Parted
Open the Terminal window and run the command:
$> sudo parted /dev/sdX

Inside the parted function, execute the command:
mklabel gpt

Execute "quit" to exit and apply the changes.

There will be multiple online tools and guides that will tell you that they are tools to convert MBR to GPT.
Proceed at your own risk. If we find any other reliable alternative to convert MBR to GPT, we will update
this article with the same. The safest approach is to back up data, format the disk, and then restore the
files.

Key Takeaways
Now let's come back to the original confusion: MBR or GPT. GPT is the preferred choice nowadays due to is
support for large drives, better data redundancy, and compatibility with UEFI based bootloaders. MBR is still
useful if you are using legacy BIOS bootloaders and older Linux distributions.

We hope we solved your MBR or GPT confusion and helped you take an informed decision. We have listed almost
all GPT vs MBR differences in Linux. You can visit this discussion thread if your system runs on Ubuntu. We
wish you all the best in ensuring optimal SSD performance and compatibility.
