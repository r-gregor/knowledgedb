How to Post Raw Body Data With cURL: A Comprehensive Guide with Examples
April 9, 2023

   cURL (Client URL) is a versatile command-line tool that allows you to transfer data to or from a
   server using various protocols, such as HTTP, FTP, and many others. It is widely used by developers
   for testing APIs, downloading files, and automating tasks. In this article, we will focus on using
   cURL to post raw body data to a server, including different data types such as JSON, XML, and plain
   text. We will also provide examples to help you understand the process better.

Installing cURL
   Before diving into the examples, ensure that cURL is installed on your system. cURL is pre-installed
   on most Linux and macOS systems. To check if it's installed, open a terminal and type:


$> curl --version

   If it's not installed, follow the installation instructions for your operating system:
     * Linux: Use your package manager (e.g., sudo apt-get install curl for Debian-based distributions).
     * macOS: Install using Homebrew (brew install curl).
     * Windows: Download the cURL executable from the official website (https://curl.se/download.html)
       and follow the installation instructions.

Sending a POST request with raw body data
   After installing cURL, you can use it to send a POST request with raw body data. We'll discuss three
   common data types: JSON, XML, and plain text. For the testing purposes, you can use
   https://webhook.site for your examples commands.

JSON
   To send a POST request with JSON data, use the -d or --data option followed by the JSON string, and
   set the "Content-Type" header to "application/json". For example:

$> curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"key": "value"}' https://api.example.com/endpoint

XML
   To send a POST request with XML data, use the -d or --data option followed by the XML string, and set
   the "Content-Type" header to "application/xml". For example:

$> curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/xml" -d '<root><key>value</key></root>' https://api.example.com/endpoint

Plain Text
   To send a POST request with plain text data, use the -d or --data option followed by the text string,
   and set the "Content-Type" header to "text/plain". For example:


$> curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: text/plain" -d 'This is a plain text message.' https://api.example.com/endpoint

Additional cURL options
     * -X: Specifies the request method (e.g., GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
     * -H: Sets a custom header.
     * -o: Saves the output to a file.
     * --silent: Hides the progress meter and error messages.
     * -v or --verbose: Displays more detailed information about the request and response.

Troubleshooting common issues
     * Double-check the API endpoint and the request method.
     * Ensure the data is properly formatted (e.g., correct JSON or XML syntax).
     * Verify that the Content-Type header is correctly set.
     * Review the API documentation for required headers, authentication, or specific request formats.

Conclusion
   In this article, we've discussed how to post raw body data with cURL, including JSON, XML, and plain
   text examples. We've also covered some additional cURL options and troubleshooting tips. With this
   knowledge, you should be able to use cURL effectively to interact with APIs and transfer data to a
   server.

   As you continue to work with cURL, remember to consult its documentation (https://curl.se/docs/)
   for more information about its features, options, and use cases. Mastering cURL can be a valuable
   skill for any developer or system administrator, as it enables you to automate tasks, test APIs, and
   handle various data transfer scenarios. Keep practicing, and happy curling!
