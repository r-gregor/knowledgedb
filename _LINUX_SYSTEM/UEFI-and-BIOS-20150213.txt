Portable installed system that boots in UEFI as well as BIOS mode

   This web page describes how to install a portable Ubuntu system, that boots in UEFI as well as BIOS
   mode.

Not stable enough to survive certain updates

   I expected that it could be installed into a USB pendrive as a good alternative to a persistent live
   system, possible to update and upgrade without limits. But unfortunately a current update involving a
   new kernel and updating grub will make it fail to boot. So this system is not stable enough to
   survive certain updates. It is good only as an illustration of a method to make a bootable drive in
   UEFI as well as BIOS mode.

   It might help to prepare by reading the following link

Make a system bootable in UEFI as well as BIOS

   Instructions how to make an installed system (typically in a USB pendrive) that works with UEFI and
   BIOS, and is small enough to work in an undersized 8 GB pendrive (7.8 GB).

   It is easier to find a fast pendrive of 16 GB or larger size. [35]Look for USB 3 pendrives, move the
   swap and grow the root partition to use the whole drive.

A. Make an install CD/DVD/USB drive from a current Ubuntu 64-bit desktop iso file

   Use standard Ubuntu, Kubuntu, Lubuntu, Xubuntu, Ubuntu Gnome, Ubuntu Studio, Edubuntu ...

   [36]http://www.ubuntu.com/download

   [37]http://www.ubuntu.com/download/alternative-downloads

   [38]http://releases.ubuntu.com

   and check the md5sum with the listed value at [39]https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UbuntuHashes

B. Boot into UEFI mode from the install drive

C. Connect a target USB pendrive, where the system is to be installed

D. Wipe the target USB pendrive if necessary

E. Start gparted

F. Device -- Create partition table -- Advanced -- gpt

   You may need to reboot to inform the kernel of the change.

G. [If complaint about rebooting]

   Boot into UEFI mode from the install drive, connect the target USB pendrive, and start gparted again.

H. Create partitions

   1a. Make a 1 MiB partition without file system (unformatted)

   1b. Add the flag bios_grub.

   2a. Make a 250 MiB partition with FAT32 file system and the label EFI

   2b. Add the boot flag

   3. Make a 6838 MiB partition with ext4 file system and the label pendrive (the size and label can be
   modified to fit the pendrive).

   4. Make a 348 MiB swap partition (linux-swap) (the size can be modified to fit the pendrive).

I. Check partitions

sudo parted -l|grep gpt
[should have the output]
Partition table: gpt

sudo parted -l|tail -n8
[should have the output (unless you modified the sizes)]
Number  Start   End     Size    File system     Name  Flags
 1      1049kB  2097kB  1049kB                        bios_grub
 2      2097kB  264MB   262MB   fat32                 boot
 3      264MB   7434MB  7170MB  ext4
 4      7434MB  7799MB  365MB   linux-swap(v1)

sudo blkid|grep EFI
[should have an output similar to this]
/dev/sdx2; LABEL="EFI" UUID= ....

sudo blkid|grep pendrive
[should have an output similar to this]
/dev/sdx3; LABEL="pendrive" UUID= ....

J. Check that you are still in UEFI mode

   Install Ubuntu (or your favourite flavour of Ubuntu) into the partition 'pendrive' (use 'Something
   else' at the partitioning window).

   The following instructions assume that you install Ubuntu 12.04.4 LTS desktop 64-bit, but it should
   work with other current 64-bit systems with minor modifications.

   Partition #3 on the target drive should be used as ext4 and have the mount point / and need not be
   formatted (it was formatted with gparted).

   Check that the device for boot loader installation is the same target drive with the root partition
   (at the bottom of the partitioning window).

   Select time zone, language, user name, computer name, password ... and let the installer finish.

K. Reboot into the installer

   Install Boot-Repair and run it to 'repair' the installed system in the target pendrive.
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:yannubuntu/boot-repair
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install boot-repair

   Unmount all partitions of the target pendrive, particularly /dev/sdx3 'pendrive'.
boot-repair

   Run 'Recommended repair'

L. Shutdown

   Wait for the shutdown process to finish. Remove the install CD/DVD/USB drive.

M. Boot into the target drive. It should boot in UEFI mode

   If problems, repeat K, L, M.

   Run the command
sudo update-grub

   without any other drive connected or edit manually the file /boot/grub/grub.cfg to get a clean grub
   menu (remove the menuentries for 30_os-prober)

N. Change the computer's setting from UEFI to BIOS (sometimes called CSM)

O. Boot into the installer in BIOS mode. Try Ubuntu without installing

P. Repair grub (in BIOS mode)

sudo mount /dev/sdXY /mnt
# Example: sudo mount /dev/sdb3 /mnt
sudo grub-install --boot-directory=/mnt/boot /dev/sdX
# Example: sudo grub-install --boot-directory=/mnt/boot /dev/sdb

Q. Similar to K. but now in BIOS mode

   Install Boot-Repair and run it to 'repair' the installed system in the target pendrive.
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:yannubuntu/boot-repair
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install boot-repair

   Unmount all partitions of the target pendrive, particularly /dev/sdx3 'pendrive'.
boot-repair

   Run 'Recommended repair'

R. Repeat P. Repair grub (in BIOS mode)

S. Shutdown

   Wait for the shutdown process to finish. Remove the install CD/DVD/USB drive.

T. Boot into the target drive. It should boot in BIOS mode

U. Reboot

   Change the computer setting to UEFI and check that it can boot from the target drive.

V. Repeat [only if necessary]

   Repeat K. Boot-Repair in UEFI mode and after that repeat P. repair grub in BIOS mode

Final system tweaks

W. Decrease wear for a pendrive

   Add the mount option noatime in /etc/fstab
# / was on /dev/sdb3 during installation
UUID=4c518694-d97c-4910-bb7b-eeb6a6b73874  /  ext4  noatime,errors=remount-ro 0  1

   It is also possible to remove the swap partition and the swap entry in /etc/fstab in order to avoid
   wear due to swapping.

X. Move swap and grow root partitions

   Move the swap partition and grow the root partition to use the whole drive. See this link

   [40]http://phillw.net/isos/linux-tools/uefi-n-bios/GrowIt.pdf

Y. Login and password for the system to download

   The system that is installed from the compressed image file

   [41]http://phillw.net/isos/linux-tools/uefi-n-bios/dd_Ubuntu-UEFI-n-BIOS-7.8GB.img.xz

   has the following user and password
user:     guru
password: changeme

Installation from a compressed image file

   Download the compressed image file dd_Ubuntu-UEFI-n-BIOS-7.8GB.img.xz from

   [42]http://phillw.net/isos/linux-tools/uefi-n-bios and check the md5sum.

in Linux

   The target drive will be overwritten. Double-check which is the target drive, the drive you want to
   install into!

   Use mkusb to install the system from the compressed image file. See the [43]Ubuntu Forums tutorial
   "Howto make USB boot drives"

in Windows

   Check the download and clone the image in Windows

   Download the following help programs

   [44]http://www.md5summer.org

   [45]http://www.7-zip.org

   [46]http://sourceforge.net/projects/win32diskimager

   First check that the download was successful with md5summer according to the file md5sums.txt.asc.

   Next extract the image file with 7-zip (It is also possible with winzip)

   from dd_Ubuntu-UEFI-n-BIOS-7.8GB.img.xz to dd_Ubuntu-UEFI-n-BIOS-7.8GB.img

   The target drive will be overwritten. Double-check which is the target drive, the drive you want to
   install into!

   Then write the extracted image file (without the ending gz) with win32diskimager

   Win32diskimager looks for img files.
