Private home directories for Ubuntu 21.04
February, 1-st, 2021

   Ubuntu has evolved a lot since its early beginnings as an easier-to-use derivative of Debian that
   catered primarily to the nascent Linux desktop market. Today Ubuntu is deployed beyond just your
   laptops at home and in the office.  Nowadays you are more likely to find Ubuntu in the cloud,
   powering some of the world's best known enterprises and running on various IoT devices out in the
   field. With this shift in adoption has come many different technical challenges and trade-offs due to
   the competing demands of each of these environments. One such challenge that is always front-of-mind
   for Ubuntu developers is the tension between security and usability. With an early and continued
   focus on both usability and security, Ubuntu has prided itself on being the go-to choice for both
   users and developers. The choice of appropriate sensible defaults lets users be productive without
   having to fight against their operating system.

   In modern environments, strong security is paramount. This is best achieved through a
   defense-in-depth approach, where multiple controls and elements are used to achieve a more resilient
   solution. For Ubuntu, this has always been a priority and has led to the creation of various default
   security features. These include no open network ports by default, automatic security updates,
   enablement of security controls like AppArmor and snaps for seamless application sandboxing, and the
   use of a wide range of compiler hardening features ensure that Ubuntu provides not only a high degree
   of usability, but a very strong security posture out-of-the-box.

   One particular security/usability trade-off that has often been cited over the years is the choice of
   default permissions for the user's home directory. At a high level, traditional directory permissions
   (like files) are broken down into 3 types (read, write and execute) and these can be assigned
   independently for 3 categories of users (owner, group and others). This allows a user to restrict
   access to files within a private directory to only their own user, or to allow access to public data
   to other users on the system on a directory-by-directory basis. When creating a new user for Ubuntu
   (whether during the installation process or after) their home directory will be created with a
   default set of permissions - and traditionally this has been chosen to enable shared access to files
   within home directories by enabling both read and execute permissions for other users. This default
   was chosen in the early days of Ubuntu, to support use-cases like multiple family members sharing a
   single PC and wanting to easily share files with one another or within university environments to
   support easy collaboration. The addition of per-user home directory encryption was also provided
   during this time, to provide privacy for those users who required it. However, as alluded to earlier,
   these use-cases for Ubuntu are perhaps now a bit quaint when considered in the modern era of cloud
   computing and IoT which have very different requirements and security exposure. With this in mind,
   for the forthcoming Ubuntu 21.04 release we have decided to switch to a more private default, so that
   for new installations of Ubuntu 21.04, or for users created on a machine that has been upgraded to
   Ubuntu 21.04,  home directories will be private by default.

   For a lot of systems that have only one primary user, this change may not appear to have a huge
   impact. However, whilst these machines may have only one human user, they likely have other user
   accounts already on them which are created by various system services. This change now means that in
   the future if an attacker were to exploit some previously unknown vulnerability in a given system
   service that is running as a separate user, they would then not be able to access the data of any
   other user (both human or system service) on the system. This provides a more secure out-of-the-box
   experience for users and system administrators.

   There may be some existing use-cases that are affected by this change - for example, a user running
   libvirt based virtual machines who stores the disk images within their home directory. In this case,
   the virtual machines run under the libvirt-qemu user and so with this new permission change, any
   virtual machines stored within the user's home directory are now not able to be accessed by libvirt.
   To resolve this, a user can give selective access to these files via the use of an appropriate access
   control list entry for their home directory as follows:
$> setfacl -m u:libvirt-qemu:rx $HOME

   This specifies that the libvirt-qemu user should have read and execute permission for the home
   directory of the user - which allows libvirt-qemu to see the names and contents of any virtual
   machine images as required.

   If you wish to try this out now, you can also make the same changes for an existing Ubuntu
   installation so that any existing or newly created home directories private by default:
# make all existing home directories private
$> sudo chmod 750 /home/*
# ensure any users created by either the adduser(8) or useradd(8)
# commands have their home directories private by default
$> sudo sed -i s/DIR_MODE=0755/DIR_MODE=0750/ /etc/adduser.conf
$> echo "HOME_MODE 0750" | sudo tee -a /etc/login.defs

   Conversely, if you wish to disable this feature once you are running Ubuntu 21.04 and return to
   having shared access to home directories by default, simply run the following commands:
# change adduser(8) to enable permissive home directory permissions
$> sudo dpkg-reconfigure adduser
# and ensure useradd also follows suit
$> sudo sed -i 's/^\(HOME_MODE\s\+0750\)/#\1/' /etc/login.defs

   This is just one small example of how Ubuntu offers both a high degree of usability and security by
   default, and how we continue to evolve this balance over time.
