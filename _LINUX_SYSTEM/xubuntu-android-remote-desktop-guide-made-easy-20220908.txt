Xubuntu-Android Remote Desktop Guide Made Easy
Wednesday, August 24, 2022

   This tutorial will explain how you can setup a basic remote desktop between Xubuntu (Xfce desktop)
   computer and Android phone using TigerVNC technology in a local area network. We will show that
   you can do this excellently without relying to software that is not free nor third-party service.

Overview
----------------------------------------------------------------
Xubuntu computer            Wifi Router            Android phone
192.168.1.80      <-->      192.168.1.1   <-->     192.168.1.81
(VNC server)                (router)               (VNC client)
----------------------------------------------------------------

Requirements
   1. AVNC on Android phone (download on F-Droid).
   2. Tiger VNC Server on Ubuntu computer.
   3. A local network, both wifi and cable will work.

First Setup
   1. On Ubuntu computer, install tigervnc server program.
$> sudo apt-get install tigervnc-standalone-server

   2. Setup VNC server password:
$> vncpasswd
Password:
Verify:
Would you like to enter a view-only password (y/n)? n
A view-only password is not used

   3. Edit Xfce desktop-specific text configuration for VNC server. Run this command and copy-paste the
   text lines into it.
$> nano ~/.vnc/xstartup
#!/bin/sh
# Start up the standard system desktop specific to Xfce or Xubuntu
# Source: https://bytexd.com
unset SESSION_MANAGER
unset DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS
/usr/bin/startxfce4
[ -x /etc/vnc/xstartup ] && exec /etc/vnc/xstartup
[ -r $HOME/.Xresources ] && xrdb $HOME/.Xresources
x-window-manager &

   4. Give executable permission to the configuration file:
$> chmod +x ~/.vnc/xstartup

   5. Start VNC server:
$> vncserver -localhost no :1

   5. Check if VNC server is running:
$> vncserver -list
TigerVNC server sessions:
X DISPLAY #    RFB PORT #    RFB UNIX PATH    PROCESS ID #    SERVER
1              5901                           3668            Xtigervnc

   6. Check Xubuntu computer's IPv4 address by clicking network manager (at the top) > Connection
   Information > note the IPv4 address.


Second Setup
   1. On Android phone, run AVNC.
   2. Create a new connection with details as the following then save:
     * Name: Remote PC
     * Host: 192.168.1.80
     * Port: 5901
     * Password: master

   3. Tap the connection name "Remote PC"
   4. Xubuntu desktop displayed on Android phone.

   Note: long press a saved connection in order to Edit it.

The Result
   Once established, you will see Xubuntu desktop on your Android phone's display. Top, double tap, long
   press and do any other finger gesture to control your Xubuntu computer remotely. Learn the gestures
   next section.

Controls
   Tap = click.
   Double tap = double click.
   Long press = right-click.
   Two-Fingers Tap = activate on-screen keyboard.
   Pinch = zoom.
   Back, Home = close remote desktop.

Stop Remote Desktop
   On computer, run the command line:
$> vncserver -kill :1

   On phone, tap Home button.

   That's all.

Afterword
   To this point, you should be able to setup a very basic remote desktop with what you have at home,
   namely, Android phone and Xubuntu computer. As we said "basic", this tutorial does not covers further
   setups like resolution choices and encryption. We planned to publish more about that later. See you
   next time!
