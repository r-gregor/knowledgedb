   How can I do black-and-white-only printing for even color sources?

   Most pdf filre are colored, but acroread doesn't has the option to let me choose to print
   black-and-white-only.

   I tried the following in acroread printer command configuration, but still, acroread prints
   color outputs.
/usr/bin/lpr -P my_printer -o saturation=0

   Please help.

   Can I give my printer an alias for black-and-white-only printing, and use that whenever I
   want to print black-and-white?

   thanks

   You should have a file /etc/cups/ppd/xxxx.ppd, where xxxx is the name you have configured
   your printer with. Please post (an URL to) this PPD.

Printing black-and-white

   Well, the PPD offers to select one of two color models: CMYK color and Grayscale:
*OpenUI *ColorModel/Output Mode: PickOne
*OrderDependency: 10 AnySetup *ColorModel
*DefaultColorModel: CMYK
*ColorModel CMYK/Color: "<</cupsColorOrder 1/cupsColorSpace 8/cupsCompression 1>>setpagedevice"
*ColorModel Gray/Grayscale: "<</cupsColorOrder 0/cupsColorSpace 3/cupsCompression 1>>setpagedevice"
*CloseUI: *ColorModel

   Thus, if your printer is configured properly, you simply could (either by using the lpadmin
   command or the "configure printer" from the web admin) set the default color model to
   Grayscale. You could even edit your printer's PPD "by hand" by replacing
*DefaultColorModel: CMYK

   by
*DefaultColorModel: Gray

   And you may easily set up two print queues - one configured for color printing and the
   other for b/w printing as indicated above - pointing to the same physical printer.

   Please RTFM. The saturation (and hue) options only affect image printing (not PostScript).

   The brightness option *should* work, but with the sample drivers the effect might not be
   all that noticeableâ€¦

   "Command-line Tools".

   No! This is an efficient way which may lead to a broken CUPS system. To increase
   efficiency, copy the files while the other cupsd is running and for maximum efficiency also
   copy files from the spool directory ;-)

   Please read [2]http://en.opensuse.org/SDB:CUPS_in_a_Nutshell "General information on the
   command-line tools"

   Johannes Meixner

CUPS Command-line Tools

   [3]http://en.opensuse.org/SDB:CUPS_in_a_Nutshell#Command-line_Tools

General information on the command-line tools:

     * Do not edit the configuration files in /etc/cups/ manually if suitable command-line
       tools are available for this purpose.

   Reason:

   The configuration files are not reloaded for every print job. Rather, cupsd keeps much of
   the information in the main memory and writes information back to the configuration files
   whenever needed. Exception: /etc/cups/cupsd.conf

   After modifications in this configuration file, cupsd must be restarted in order to make it
   use the modified configuration. See Section "Restarting the CUPS Server" in the "CUPS
   Software Administrators Manual" [4]http://localhost:631/sam.html#RESTARTING or
   file:///usr/share/doc/packages/cups/sam.html#RESTARTING.
     * Never copy configuration files from other systems to your system unless you know
       exactly what you are doing. Use command-line tools instead.

   For example, to set up the same queues on several machines (e.g., for a backup server), do
   not copy /etc/cups/printers.conf and /etc/cups/ppd/*, but write the respective commands in
   a script (usually a sequence of lpadmin commands) and run the script on the various
   machines. In this way, any error messages will be displayed on the respective machines
   (e.g., if a PPD file is not available on a machine or if a backend is not available or not
   ready to use). Furthermore with such a script you have something like a log-file of the
   settings, enabling you to restore the settings by running the script at any time.
     * If you are not sure which graphical tool is best suited for certain special
       configurations, use command-line tools instead.
     * In many cases, the sequence of the options is significant. Read the man pages. For
       example, the following commands are all different:
lpadmin -E -p queue,
lpadmin -p queue -E
lpadmin -E -p queue -E

Details

   Command-line tools for creating or editing queues:
     * Example for creating a queue:
root@host# lpadmin -p funprinter1000 -v parallel:/dev/lp0 -E -P /usr/share/cups/model/Postscript.ppd
.gz

   Use the following command to check what was created:
user@host$ lpstat -a funprinter1000 -p funprinter1000 -v funprinter1000
funprinter1000 accepting requests since Jan 01 00:00
printer funprinter1000 is idle.  enabled since Jan 01 00:00
device for funprinter1000: parallel:/dev/lp0

   Alternatively, take a look at /etc/cups/printers.conf:
<Printer funprinter1000>
Info funprinter1000
DeviceURI parallel:/dev/lp0
State Idle
Accepting Yes
JobSheets none none
QuotaPeriod 0
PageLimit 0
KLimit 0
</Printer>

   Or query the system with the web front-end: [5]http://localhost:631/printers/funprinter1000
     * Editing the queue (e.g., changing the description and location):
root@host# lpadmin -p funprinter1000 -D "ACME FunPrinter 1000" -L "2. floor: room 3"
     * Displaying the printer-specific options and their default settings in
       /etc/cups/ppd/funprinter1000.ppd:
user@host$ lpoptions -p funprinter1000 -l
Resolution/Output Resolution: 150dpi *300dpi 600dpi 1200dpi 2400dpi
PageSize/Media Size: Letter Legal Executive *A4 A5
...

   The output has the following syntax:
main-keyword/translation-string: option-keyword option-keyword option-keyword ...

   The default setting is marked with an * preceding the "option-keyword".
     * Changing the printer-specific default settings in /etc/cups/ppd/funprinter1000.ppd:
root@host# lpadmin -p funprinter1000 -o Resolution=600dpi -o PageSize=Letter

   The syntax is as follows:
lpadmin -p queue -o main-keyword1=option-keyword1 -o main-keyword2=option-keyword2 ...

   Do not use lpoptions for this purpose. Refer to the Support Database article "Print
   Settings with CUPS": SDB:Print Settings with CUPS. Normal users can use lpoptions to save
   their personal default settings in ~/.lpoptions. More information on this is presented in
   the same Support Database article.
     * Use "accept" and "reject" to accept and reject print jobs for a queue. Use
       "/usr/bin/enable" ("enable" is a bash built-in) and "disable" to enable and disable
       printing in a queue (e.g., to avoid print jobs from being lost while doing maintenance
       work on the printer).
     * Deleting the queue:
root@host# lpadmin -x funprinter1000

Command-line tools for daily use

   [6]http://en.opensuse.org/SDB:CUPS_in_a_Nutshell
     * Avoid BSD-type commands (lpr, lpq, lprm), as these only support a limited number of
       generic options. Use System V-type commands (lp, lpstat, cancel) instead.
     * Use lpoptions to save personal printer-specific option settings in ~/.lpoptions.
       Example:
user@host$ lpoptions -o Resolution=1200dpi -p funprinter1000
     * The generally available printing options are described in the Section "Standard Printer
       Options" in the "CUPS Software Users Manual":
       http://localhost:631/sum.html#STANDARD_OPTIONS or
       file:///usr/share/doc/packages/cups/sum.html#STANDARD_OPTIONS

How to: Migrate Linux Printer Configuration to Another System

   I've already outlined the detailed steps for [8]migrating users, home directories and email
   to a new Linux server. I received a couple of emails asking about migrating printer
   configuration. From my mail bag:

     Is it possible to migrate the printer configuration from one machine to another, just
     like user migration?

   Yes, it is possible since Linux uses CUPS i.e. the common unix printing system. It is a
   modular printing system for Unix-like computer operating systems that allows a computer to
   act as a print server. A computer running [9]CUPS is a host that can accept print jobs from
   client computers, process them, and send them to the appropriate printer.

Migrate Linux Printer Configuration

   CUPS stores its configuration at /etc/cups directory, so all you have to do is copy
   /etc/cups to a new computer. Open terminal and type the commands on old Linux computer:
   # tar -cvzf /tmp/cups-$(hostname).tar.gz /etc/cups
   Copy /tmp/cups* to new system using SCP or use USB pen driver:
   # scp /tmp/cups* new.linux.server.com:/tmp

   Now login to new system and type the following commands:
   # mv /etc/cups /etc/cups.backup
   # cd /
   # tar -zcvf /tmp/cups*
   Finally, restart the cups service:
   # /etc/init.d/cupsys restart

Move or migrate user accounts from old Linux server to a new Linux server

   Q. How do I Move or migrate user accounts to from old Linux server a new Cent OS Linux
   server including mails? This new system a fresh installation.

   A. You can migrate users from old Linux server to new Linux sever with standard commands
   such as tar, awk, scp and others. This is also useful if you are using old Linux
   distribution such as Redhat 9 or Debian 2.x.

   Following files/dirs are required for traditional Linux user management:
   * [33]/etc/passwd - contains various pieces of information for each user account

   * [34]/etc/shadow - contains the encrypted password information for user's accounts and
   optional the password aging information.
   * [35]/etc/group - defines the groups to which users belong

   * /etc/gshadow - group shadow file (contains the encrypted password for group)

   * /var/spool/mail - Generally user emails are stored here.

   * /home - All Users data is stored here.

   You need to backup all of the above files and directories from old server to new Linux
   server.

Commands to type on old Linux system

   First create a tar ball of old uses (old Linux system). Create a directory:
   # mkdir /root/move/
   Setup UID filter limit:
   # export UGIDLIMIT=500
   Now copy /etc/passwd accounts to /root/move/passwd.mig using awk to filter out system
   account (i.e. only copy user accounts)
   # awk -v LIMIT=$UGIDLIMIT -F: '($3>=LIMIT) && ($3!=65534)' /etc/passwd >
   /root/move/passwd.mig
   Copy /etc/group file:
   # awk -v LIMIT=$UGIDLIMIT -F: '($3>=LIMIT) && ($3!=65534)' /etc/group >
   /root/move/group.mig
   Copy /etc/shadow file:
   # awk -v LIMIT=$UGIDLIMIT -F: '($3>=LIMIT) && ($3!=65534) {print $1}' /etc/passwd | tee -
   |egrep -f - /etc/shadow > /root/move/shadow.mig
   Copy /etc/gshadow (rarely used):
   # cp /etc/gshadow /root/move/gshadow.mig
   Make a backup of /home and /var/spool/mail dirs:
   # tar -zcvpf /root/move/home.tar.gz /home
   # tar -zcvpf /root/move/mail.tar.gz /var/spool/mail

   Where,
     * Users that are added to the Linux system always start with UID and GID values of as
       specified by Linux distribution or set by admin. Limits according to different Linux
       distro:

     * RHEL/CentOS/Fedora Core : Default is 500 and upper limit is 65534 (/etc/libuser.conf).
     * Debian and Ubuntu Linux : Default is 1000 and upper limit is 29999 (/etc/adduser.conf).

     You should never ever create any new system user accounts on the newly installed Cent OS
   Linux. So above awk command filter out UID according to Linux distro.

     export UGIDLIMIT=500 - setup UID start limit for normal user account. Set this value as
   per your Linux distro.

     awk -v LIMIT=$UGIDLIMIT -F: '($3>=LIMIT) && ($3!=65534)' /etc/passwd >
   /root/move/passwd.mig - You need to pass UGIDLIMIT variable to awk using -v option (it
   assigns value of shell variable UGIDLIMIT to awk program variable LIMIT). Option -F: sets
   the field separator to : . Finally awk read each line from /etc/passwd, filter out system
   accounts and generates new file /root/move/passwd.mig. Same logic is applies to rest of awk
   command.

     tar -zcvpf /root/move/home.tar.gz /home - Make a backup of users /home dir

     tar -zcvpf /root/move/mail.tar.gz /var/spool/mail - Make a backup of users mail dir

   Use scp or usb pen or tape to copy /root/move to a new Linux system.
   # scp -r /root/move/* user@new.linuxserver.com:/path/to/location

  Commands to type on new Linux system

   First, make a backup of current users and passwords:
   # mkdir /root/newsusers.bak
   # cp /etc/passwd /etc/shadow /etc/group /etc/gshadow /root/newsusers.bak
   Now restore passwd and other files in /etc/
   # cd /path/to/location
   # cat passwd.mig >> /etc/passwd
   # cat group.mig >> /etc/group
   # cat shadow.mig >> /etc/shadow
   # /bin/cp gshadow.mig /etc/gshadow

   Please note that you must use >> (append) and not > (create) shell redirection.

   Now copy and extract home.tar.gz to new server /home
   # cd /
   # tar -zxvf /path/to/location/home.tar.gz

   Now copy and extract mail.tar.gz (Mails) to new server /var/spool/mail
   # cd /
   # tar -zxvf /path/to/location/mail.tar.gz

   Now reboot system; when the Linux comes back, your user accounts will work as they did
   before on old system:
   # reboot

   Please note that if you are new to Linux perform above commands in a sandbox environment.
   Above technique can be used to UNIX to UNIX OR UNIX to Linux account migration. You need to
   make couple of changes but overall the concept remains the same.

Command-line Printing

Command-line options

   Most of our printers can handle advanced job modification options and can print
   non-PostScript files like PDF and JPEG without requiring manual conversion by the user. The
   job options allow one to specify a subset of pages to print, output order, the number of
   document pages printed on a single printed page, and more. To see all of these options,
   please refer to [6]http://www.cups.org/sum.html#4_3.

   Here is a partial list of options:
     * lpr filename
     * lpr -P printer filename
     * lpr -o landscape -o scaling=75 -o media=A4 filename.jpg
     * lpr -#num-copies filename
     * lpr -#num-copies -o Collate=True filename
     * lpr -o media=Letter,Transparency filename
     * lpr -o media=Letter,MultiPurpose,Transparency filename
     * lpr -o landscape filename
     * lpr -o portrait filename
     * lpr -o sides=one-sided filename
     * lpr -o sides=two-sided-long-edge filename
     * lpr -o job-sheets=classified,classified filename
     * lpr -o page-ranges=1-4,7,9-12 filename
     * lpr -o page-set=even filename
     * lpr -o outputorder=reverse filename
     * lpr -o number-up=4 filename
     * lpr -o number-up=16 filename
     * lpr -o mirror filename
     * lpr -o brightness=120 filename
     * lpr -o gamma=1700 filename
     * lpr -o cpi=17 filename
     * lpr -o lpi=8 filename
     * lpr -o columns=3 filename
     * lpr -o page-bottom=value filename
     * lpr -o prettyprint filename
     * lpr -o natural-scaling=percent filename
     * lpr -o hue=value filename
     * lpr -o saturation=percent filename
     * lpr -o blackplot filename
     * lpr -o fitplot filename
     * lpr -o penwidth=value filename
     * lpr -o raw filename
     * lpr -l filename

Examining the queue

   The printing system will often enqueue, dequeue, and delivers a job to the printer before
   you have a chance to see that it has actually arrived on the queue. This may lead you to
   believe that your job hasn't printed since 'lpq' won't show your job when in fact it has
   already been accepted by the printer. To view a list of jobs that the printer has already
   received, run 'lpstat -W completed -o PRINTER' where PRINTER is where you sent your job.
   You can also run 'lpstat -W completed -u USERNAME' to see all jobs completed by the user
   USERNAME.

Printer aliases

   It is possible to create a printer alias using a list of options so that if you send a job
   to the printer alias, it is modified by the options specified in the alias.

   For instance, the command 'lpoptions -p 491/4s -o sides=one-sided -o number-up=4' creates
   the printer alias 491/4s with the options for simplex and 4-up printing. If one then sends
   a job to 491/4s without any additional options, e.g. 'lpr -P 491/4s' the job will be
   automatically simplexed and 4-upped. These options are saved to the file '~/.lpoptions'.

   You must always specify a printer alias using the slash (/) character.

Printing in landscape mode

   To print plain text in landscape mode use the command 'enscript' with the '-r' option. TeX
   output can be printed using the '-t landscape' option of 'dvips'. PostScript can be printed
   using the '-r' option of 'psnup'. For example, "psnup -n1 -r file.ps".

http://www.njae.me.uk/CUPS_server_setup

CUPS server setup

   CUPS is easy to set up. Out of the box, CUPS only allows connections from localhost. That's
   OK for the desktop machine, but is a bit of a problem for setting up the server. Modify
   /etc/cups/cupsd.conf at the top to look like this:
## Only listen for connections from the local machine.
# Listen localhost:631
# Listen for connections from anywhere
Port 631
Listen /var/run/cups/cups.sock
ServerAlias desktop.domain.tld
ServerAlias printer.domain.tld

   (the ServerAlias line is needed to allow the server to respond to remote requests. Repeat
   this line for each alias the CUPS server responds to. See [9]Ubuntu bug 516018 for
   details.)

   Add the Allow @LOCAL lines in the two Location stanzas in the same file:
<Location />
 # Allow shared printing and remote administration...
 Order allow,deny
 Allow @LOCAL
</Location>
<Location /admin>
 # Allow remote administration...
 Order allow,deny
 Allow @LOCAL
</Location>

   then restart CUPS:
root@server:~# service cups restart

   You should then be able to point a webbrowser at desktop.server.tld:631 or
   server.domain.tld:631 and configure printers via the web interface.

   As I have printers attached to both machines, and I want various Windows boxes to use the
   printers, I need to publish the printer details. On the Administration page, select these
   options:
     * Show printers shared by other systems
     * Share published printers connected to this system
     * Allow printing from the Internet
     * Allow remote administration
     * Allow users to cancel any job (not just their own)

   Do that on both machines, and you'll be able to access either printer from either machine.

   I had trouble using Chrome for the administration (I think it couldn't handle the
   certificates), so I used ReKonq instead.

Updating HPLIP

   I've got a multi-function printer (HP 1312). Scanning for this printer is not supported in
   the HPLIP that comes with Ubuntu. So I need to update it, as described on the [10]Scanner
   setup page.

Bugfix

   CUPS on Ubuntu 12.04 has a [11]bug that affects the USB backend, preventing the printer
   printing more than one job with it needing resetting. Once the printer is set up, issue the
   command:
root@server:~# lpadmin -p <printer> -o usb-no-reattach-default=true

Windows use of printers

   To allow Windows boxes to use the printers, you'll first need to create a 'raw' queue for
   each printer you want to make available. Then create a new printer in Windows. In the
   wizard, ask for a 'Printer connected to the internet', give the address as
   http://server.domain.tld:631/printers/RawPrinterQueueName, and install the Windows driver
   for that printer on the Windows box. That should be it!

   For more detailed instructions on using CUPS with Windows, see this [12]How to make Windows
   use CUPS IPP page.
     * Start a web browser and point it at http://printers.domain.tld:631/printers. Select the
       printer you want, such as http://printers.domain.tld:631/printers/RawPrinterQueueName.
       Copy this address to the clipboard.
     * Go to Control Panel > Add a new printer. Add a network printer. Don't bother searching
       for the printer, simply paste in the address you copied above.
     * Install the printer drivers as normal.

   You should now have a working printer available from CUPS.
