   How do I create disk image using dd command? How do I perform disk cloning from a live Linux cd for
   backup or recovery purpose?
   You can easily use the dd command for making an image of a partition or of a full hard disk drive.

What is a dd image?
   Disk cloning is nothing but a mere process of creating an image of an entire disk. This can be useful
   for copying disks, backups, recovery and more. The dd command is easy to use tool for making such
   clones.

   Warning: You should be very careful when using dd command; it can destroy data. Remember the order of
   input file (if=) and output file (of=).

How to clone an entire hard disk
   The syntax is:
   dd if=/dev/input/DEVICE-HERE of=/dev/OUTPUT/DEVICE-HERE bs=64K conv=noerror,sync
   To clone /dev/sdc (250G) to /dev/sdd (250G) in Linux, enter:
   # dd if=/dev/sdc of=/dev/sdd bs=64K conv=noerror,sync
   To clone /dev/ada0 (250G) to /dev/adb0 (250G) in FreeBSD, enter:
   # dd if=/dev/ada0 of=/dev/adb0 bs=64K conv=noerror,sync
   Where,
    1. if=/dev/file : Input device/file.
    2. of=/dev/file : Output device/file.
    3. bs=64k : Sets the block size to 64k. You can use 128k or any other value.
    4. conv=noerror : Tell dd to continue operation, ignoring all read errors.
    5. sync : Add input blocks with zeroes if there were any read errors, so data offsets stay in sync.

How to clone a partition
   To clone /dev/sdc1 to /dev/sdd1, enter:
   # dd if=/dev/sdc1 of=/dev/sdd1 bs=128K conv=noerror,sync
   Sample outputs:
15874+0 records in
15873+0 records out
1040252928 bytes transferred in 3.805977 secs (273320858 bytes/sec)

dd make disk image
   You can boot from a live cd. Once booted, make sure no partitions are mounted from the source hard
   drive disk. You can store disk image on an external USB disk. The syntax is as follows
   dd if=/dev/INPUT/DEVICE-NAME-HERE conv=sync,noerror bs=64K | gzip -c > /path/to/my-disk.image.gz
   In this example, create disk image for /dev/da0 i.e. cloning /dev/da0 and save in the current
   directory:
   # dd if=/dev/da0 conv=sync,noerror bs=128K | gzip -c > centos-core-7.gz
   Sample outputs:

   The above command just cloned the entire hard disk, including the MBR, bootloader, all partitions,
   UUIDs, and data.

How to restore system (dd image)
   The syntax is:
   # gunzip -c IMAGE.HERE-GZ | dd of=/dev/OUTPUT/DEVICE-HERE
   For example:
   # gunzip -c centos-core-7.gz | dd of=/dev/da0

Tip #1: Not enough disk space locally? Use remote box
   You can send the image through ssh and save it on the remove box called server1.cyberciti.biz:
   # dd if=/dev/da0 conv=sync,noerror bs=128K | gzip -c | ssh vivek@server1.cyberciti.biz dd
   of=centos-core-7.gz

Tip #2: Save extra information
     * See [18]how to save and restore MBR only.
     * Not a fan of dd? See [19]top 6 open source disk cloning and imaging softwares.
     * Want to deal with corrupted disk? [20]Try ddrescue command.
