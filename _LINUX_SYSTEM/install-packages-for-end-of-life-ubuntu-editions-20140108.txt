How to Install Packages for End of Life Ubuntu Editions

   Posted on [14]January 3, 2013 by [15]Ryann
   Listen to this Post. Powered by iSpeech.org

   I use Ubuntu 10.10. Have been for 4 years now. So, basically my installation has reached
   EOL (End of Life) and won’t receive any more updates/support as the longest supported
   editions (LTS editions) only span 4 years.

   So, what happens when your edition reaches EOL?

   First, you can no longer install new apps/packages using

   apt-get install APPNAME

   You also can’t update anything. This is because the repositories for the unsupported
   edition have been removed from the main servers.

The Good News

   Repositories for unsupported editions aren’t removed off the face of the internet universe.
   They’re moved to [16]http://old-releases.ubuntu.com/releases/.
   There's hope for you yet

   There’s hope for you yet

   To use this new repository, we just need to change software sources in
   /etc/apt/sources.list. For Ubuntu 10.10, the file should look like this:
## EOL upgrade sources.list
# Required
deb http://old-releases.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ maverick main restricted universe multiverse
deb http://old-releases.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ maverick-updates main restricted universe multiverse
deb http://old-releases.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ maverick-security main restricted universe multiverse

# Optional
#deb http://old-releases.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ maverick-backports main restricted universe multiverse
#deb http://old-releases.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ maverick-proposed main restricted universe multiverse

   That’s it.

P.S.

   Some of you might be asking why I haven’t bothered to upgrade my edition? At the time of
   this writing, latest version is at 12.10, codenamed Quantal Quetzal. So why not upgrade?
   Must be tons of new features. Plus it’s better security-wise.

   The answer is simple really.

   I have no time.

   No time to troubleshoot why upgrade hung up. No time to change the default user interface
   from Unity back to Gnome. (Why would I change it you ask? Because I prefer it) No time to
   troubleshoot why my favorite app isn’t working after the upgrade. No time to…

   I will keep using what I have until it stops working for me, or when a new app gets
   released that I really, really need but it only runs on the latest edition.

       Hey, thanks a million! I run Ubuntu 10.10 on a machine that doesn’t like Ubuntu 11 or
       12 whatsoever (older hardware). I’ve been trying to install Wine on it for the last two
       days. I had replaced all instances of the regular repositories with
       ‘old-releases.ubuntu.com’, but no dice. finally i found this and just wiped out the
       entire apt-sources file and replaced it with what you’ve got here, and then did an
       apt-get update.
       Wine is installing as we speak.

            need to update some things for some of the apps to work. worse it did to me was
            give me “update errors” so I did what I said in this article and haven’t looked

Upgrading an Old or End of life (EOL) release of ubuntu back into usefulness.

   Wed, 2013-01-16 13:26 |  Franco

   If you find yourself with an old version of ubuntu that is unable to update or upgrade, the
   solution is very simple.

   For example, if you are running Ubuntu 10.10 (Maverick Meerkat) and you want to upgrade it

   Ubuntu maintains a repo for this so open your sources file in the terminal with:
   sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list

   then comment out all your repos, and use this(substitute maverick with the old code of your
   outdated ubuntu):
   ## EOL upgrade sources.list
   # Required
   deb [19]http://old-releases.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ maverick main restricted universe multiverse
   deb [20]http://old-releases.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ maverick-updates main restricted universe
   multiverse
   deb [21]http://old-releases.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ maverick-security main restricted universe
   multiverse
   # Optional
   #deb [22]http://old-releases.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ maverick-backports main restricted universe
   multiverse

   then install the manager

   sudo apt-get install update-manager-core

   Next you can upgrade to the next version by using

   sudo do-release-upgrade

   After you are upgraded you can "sudo do-release-upgrade" again and again until you hit a
   supported version.

   The repositories for older releases that are not supported (like 9.04, 9.10, and 10.10) get
   moved to an archive server. There are repositories available at
   [46]http://old-releases.ubuntu.com

   The reason for this is that it is now out of support and no longer receiving updates and
   security patches.

   I would urge you to consider a supported distribution. If your computer is too old in terms
   of memory or processor then you should consider a distribution such as Lubuntu or Xubuntu.

   If you want to continue using an outdated release then edit /etc/apt/sources.list and
   change archive.ubuntu.com to old-releases.ubuntu.com

   You can do this with sed
sudo sed -i -e 's/archive.ubuntu.com\|security.ubuntu.com/old-releases.ubuntu.com/g' /etc/apt/source
s.list

   then update with
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade

[58]What are 404 errors

     The 404 or Not Found error message is a HTTP standard response code indicating that the
     client was able to communicate with the server, but the server could not find what was
     requested.

     The web site hosting server will typically generate "404 - Page Not Found" web page,
     when users attempts to follow a broken or dead link.

Why are we facing 404 errors

   Ubuntu follows the approach of two different [59]release cycles:

     Normal Ubuntu releases are supported for 9 months. LTS releases are supported for 5
     years.

     Past releases may have different support schedules (for example, normal releases (before
     13.04) used to be supported for 18 months, while LTS releases (before 12.04) used to be
     supported for 3 years on the desktop and 5 years on the server).

   EOL: Once the support period for a particular release is over; they are called [60]End Of
   Life (EOL) and all the updates and package repositories for that Release are transferred to
   a different server which results in 404 errors while running sudo apt-get update. You can
   confirm if your release has become EOL by going to [61]this page. If your Ubuntu release is
   mentioned under "End Of Life (EOL)" Table, then the release is no longer supported and you
   should try to upgrade to a [62]newer supported release. However, if you wish to continue
   using this unsupported release, you would have to make necessary modifications in
   /etc/apt/sources.list to point to the old-releases server of Ubuntu.

Steps to make necessary modifications

    1. Open your Terminal:
          + Press Ctrl + Alt + T; OR
          + If you have Gnome: Applications → Accessories → Terminal; OR
          + If you have Unity: press Super (the key between Left Ctrl and Left Alt) and query
            for Terminal.
    2. Run the following command:
gksudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list

       input your user password and press Enter.
    3. Find the first line which doesn't start with #. Suppose you are running Karmic Koala
       (Ubuntu 9.10): it should be like the following line:
deb <siteurl> karmic main restricted

       where, <siteurl> is your preferred server - http://gb.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu in your
       case (for example).
    4. Press Ctrl + H to replace your <siteurl> with http://old-releases.ubuntu.com/ubuntu.
          + Search for: http://gb.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu ie; <siteurl>
          + Replace with: http://old-releases.ubuntu.com/ubuntu and
          + Press Replace All
    5. Once again:
          + Search for: http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu (this exact url for all the Ubuntu
            Releases — whatever be the present server that you are using)
          + Replace with: http://old-releases.ubuntu.com/ubuntu
          + Press Replace All
    6. Save your file and exit Gedit.
    7. Run the following command:
sudo apt-get update

   There you go. No 404 Errors this time. You can now install all the available packages for
   your Ubuntu Release. You can also run sudo apt-get dist-upgrade to install any
   Security/Bug-fix updates which have not yet been installed but you won't get any further
   Security/Bug-fix updates from Ubuntu.

   The short answer is to add the next apt repository to the Third-Party Software (or Other
   Software in newer versions) in Software Sources (or Software & Updates in newer versions):
deb http://old-releases.ubuntu.com/ubuntu jaunty main restricted universe multiverse

   The long answer...

GUI Method

   Well, actually we will do this without to use any [68]terminal. Not even once. Just GUI, I
   promise ;-)

   First, open Software Sources (or Software & Updates in newer versions). It does not matter
   how old is your Ubuntu, there is certainly something like this. For Ubuntu 9.04 (Jaunty
   Jackalope) look at next image to see where is located:

   Open Software Sources

   After Software Sources (or Software & Updates) it is open, go in Ubuntu Software and
   Updates tabs and unselect everytiyng like in next pictures. You don't need this things
   anymore since your Ubuntu version is [69]End of Life:

   Ubuntu Software tab
     ______________________________________________________________________________________

   enter image description here

   Without closing Software Sources (or Software & Updates), go in Third-Party Software (for
   newest releases this tab is named Other Software) tab and add a new apt repository. Insert
   exactly next line when you are asked:
deb http://old-releases.ubuntu.com/ubuntu jaunty main restricted universe multiverse

   If your version of Ubuntu is other than 9.04, replace in the above line jaunty with your
   Ubuntu codename (for example if you have Ubuntu 9.10, replace with karmic and so on):

   Third-Party Software tab

   Now, when you will close Software Sources (or Software & Updates) you will be asked to
   reload the information about available software. Just be sure that you have a working
   internet connection:

   Reload available software
   Downloading available software

   And now you are free to download almost whatever you want. For 9.04 you can use Synaptic
   Package Manager. For newest releases there is Ubuntu Software Center.

   For example to install VLC in Ubuntu 9.04 using Synaptic Package Manager, follow the
   instructions in the following pictures:

   Open Synaptic Package Manager

   Search VLC in SPM
   Mark VLC
   Mark aditional VLC
   Apply VLC
   Download VLC
   Open VLC

   If you want to Update your Ubuntu to a new release, just go to System > Update Manager:

   Update Manager
   Upgrade

   I tested this method from a live session of Ubuntu 9.04 (Jaunty Jackalope) and as you can
   see from these pictures it worked. If you are on an installed session of Ubuntu you will be
   asked sometimes for root or admin password. Just insert your personal user password when
   you are asked.

   I just did all this from installed 10.10 (maverick) version. Everything well good as
   described. @Radu, your answer is flawless! –  [74]Gediminas Jeremiah Gudelis Aug 28 '13 at
   20:01

   Those images needs updating... wait... what are you doing with a pre-12.04? –  [75]Braiam

   To get apt-get working again, change your software sources to the old release repositories.
gksudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list

   delete whatever is in there, and paste the following:
# Required
deb http://old-releases.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ karmic main restricted universe multiverse
deb http://old-releases.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ karmic-updates main restricted universe multiverse
deb http://old-releases.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ karmic-security main restricted universe multiverse

# Optional
#deb http://old-releases.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ karmic-backports main restricted universe multiverse

   Thanks mikewhatever, but the result is the same when I try "apt-get install lm-sensors".
   Maybe there's another missing source: "Reading package lists... Done Building dependency
   tree Reading state information... Done Package lm-sensors is not available, but is referred
   to by another package. This may mean that the package is missing, has been obsoleted, or is
   only available from another source E: Package lm-sensors has no installation candidate" –

   Here are the debs: [80]old-releases.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/l/lm-sensors-3. I trust it,
   you've reloaded the sources list, right? –  [81]mikewhatever Apr 13 '12 at 12:08

   It appears the Karmic repositories are [82]no longer available.

   Since they are for a previous version of Ubuntu, you might consider removing them from your
   sources list. Take a look at [83]this help page for step-by-step.

   You can find the repositories under the "old-releases" server
   [89]http://old-releases.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/

   And about how to edit the /etc/apt/sources.list

Introduction
This page will explain how to upgrade an End of Life (EOL) release of Ubuntu to a
supported system. This guide is not limited to Ubuntu (with the Gnome desktop). Any
Ubuntu flavor (Kubuntu/Edubuntu and/or server installation and others) can use this
guide. For upgrading supported releases please refer to this document. Mac users may
have some difficulty upgrading to the most current release around versions 7.04/7.10.

If you want to know whether your release is EOL please have a look at the following
resources:

https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Releases

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Ubuntu_releases

http://www.ubuntu.com/products/ubuntu/release-cycle

These guides assumes that the user knows his way on the terminal, as no graphical
tools are used. This said, the steps for executing all the commands are actually
copy/pasteable so everyone, from beginner to advanced user running EOL releases of
Ubuntu can execute the upgrade(s).

In case of problems you should be aware that most (if not all) of the releases
which are mentioned in this guide are UNSUPPORTED, and getting help may be a
bit tricky since most of us have already upgraded to a more recent version of
Ubuntu. You could always try to run the upgrade path first in a virtual machine
(vmware/virtualbox/qemu or others). All the upgrades of this guide were performed and
tested in virtual machines (except for 6.10 to 7.10 which were executed on a Compaq/HP
laptop NC6000). You can make a backup of your disks/partitions using Clonezilla.

Why upgrade
Why should you upgrade instead of performing a clean install of a supported
version? Some don't like to perform new installations when there is a possibility
to upgrade. The advantage of this is that you can keep your current configuration
without having to change much. This is often the case in production environments
where you don't want to lose a machine just because it needs a higher OS version.

The scientific approach. It is possible to do, so why wouldn't we give it a
shot? This is how I started out writing this guide. I had to help someone else,
who was in another timezone and I thought my sleep was precious so I wrote a guide
telling him how to upgrade to 8.04. When I was finished I decided it was fun to
see if I could upgrade from 4.10 to the most current version (I admit, I took a
shortcut when I arrived at 6.06, I upgraded directly to 8.04).

Also, if your computer cannot start a live USB for whatever reason, and all you
have is a Dapper Drake installation disc, then there's no other choice: you have
to download the updates and install them from within Ubuntu.

The last reason is more a flame. Why would we do it the Microsoft way? If we don't
know, just restart... Why don't we try to fix the issue, even if it takes a bit
more time. The time it takes per upgrade is dependent on your installation.

Why choosing a fresh install
There are reasons why one should not upgrade, but rather reinstall. They do not apply
equally to all users, but are still worth considering before choosing the approach.

From 9.04 (jaunty) ext4 becomes available. If you want to benefit from the new
features ext4 has for you then you might just as well reinstall one of the supported
releases.

The boot loader has been greatly improved. Upgrading Ubuntu does not upgrade GRUB
1 to GRUB 2, which must be done in a separate process. Although the GRUB-upgrade is
easy for an experienced user, a beginner might prefer to have this done automatically
as part of the new install.

Reinstalling might be both easier and faster. If you decide to follow the upgrade
path (which could be long, if you want to reach the latest version), it is a good
idea for future reference to keep a log of how much time was used. Compare this to
the time used for a backup and new install.

A series of upgrades often takes more bandwidth. In some parts of the world this
is a major concern.

An upgrade keeps user settings, but this is not always an advantage. If the settings
are a mess, it is sometimes better for a beginner to start on a fresh install which
also deletes /home without the risk of bringing problems along.

For both upgrade and a new install
It is not certain that every release of Ubuntu runs on the hardware in
question. Regardless if you are upgrading or doing a new install, it is always a
good start to try the new release in a live boot. A live Ubuntu runs from a CD or
a USB stick, and it does not change the installation on the hard drive.

Upgrade
This guide consists of four main parts.

The first part will cover upgrading from 8.10 to 9.04 and up (eventually to 10.04). We
will do the following upgrades, 8.10 to 9.04 to 9.10 to 10.04 LTS.

The second part will cover upgrading from 6.10 to 8.04.3 LTS. We will do the
following upgrades, 6.10 to 7.04 to 7.10 to 8.04.3 LTS.

The third part covers upgrading from 6.06 LTS to 8.04.3 LTS. This is the preferred
way of upgrading to 8.04.3 from 6.06. You will not need to upgrade to 7.x. At the
time of writing this is not an EOL upgrade.

The fourth part will be about upgrading 4.10 to 6.06.2 LTS. We will do the following
upgrades, 4.10 to 5.04 to 5.10 to 6.06.2 LTS.

Note
Ubuntu 6.06's support has ended in June 2009 for desktops and will end June 2011 for
servers. This will mean a lot of desktop applications are not supported or updated
anymore. See this list of supported packages. Upgrading 6.06.x to 8.04 is regarded
as a regular upgrade. Please see DapperUpgrades or HardyUpgrades for more information.

Requirements
/etc/apt/sources.list

Please make sure you have the following sources.list, change CODENAME to your release,
e.g. breezy.


## EOL upgrade sources.list
# Required
deb http://old-releases.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ CODENAME main restricted universe
multiverse
deb http://old-releases.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ CODENAME-updates main restricted universe
multiverse
deb http://old-releases.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ CODENAME-security main restricted
universe multiverse

# Optional
#deb http://old-releases.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ CODENAME-backports main restricted
universe multiverse
You can make use of -backports if you want, or -proposed. For more information
about repositories https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Repositories/Ubuntu

Dependencies

You should also make sure some meta-packages are installed so the upgrade can
continue without problems:

Update-manager
From version 6.06 and up you will need to install the update-manager and
update-manager-core packages.

# update-manager is something you don't want to install on cli servers
sudo aptitude install update-manager-core update-manager
For upgrading from an LTS release to a non-LTS release, make sure that the update
manager is correctly configured to upgrade any release. This is not needed when
upgrading from one LTS release to the next LTS release:


sudo perl -pi -e 's/^Prompt=.*/Prompt=normal/' /etc/update-manager/release-upgrades
Ubuntu-desktops
If you run a particular desktop version, you might want to reinstall this package
to resolve any issue with dependencies of that package. You can (re)install these
-desktop packages before or after your upgrade. To find out if you which desktop
package you want to (re)install: dpkg -l | grep tu-desktop. Or search for one by
running aptitude search tu-desktop. The correct commands to (re)install are:


# The Kubuntu desktop
sudo aptitude install kubuntu-desktop
# or
sudo aptitude reinstall kubuntu-desktop
Kernels
8.04 and up: apt:linux-image-generic,linux-headers-generic,
apt:linux-image-server,linux-headers-server or
apt:linux-image-virtual,linux-headers-virtual


sudo aptitude install linux-image-generic linux-headers-generic
# or
sudo aptitude install linux-image-server linux-headers-server
# or
sudo aptitude install linux-image-virtual linux-headers-virtual
5.04: linux-image-386 and linux-headers-386

sudo aptitude install linux-image-386 linux-headers-386
4.10: linux-image-386 and linux-kernel-headers

sudo aptitude install linux-image-386 linux-kernel-headers
Known issues
Some issues are related to apt-get upgrade and dist-upgrade commands. If you get
calculation errors when running do-release-upgrade you can resolve this issue
by running do-release-upgrade -m desktop or you can remove the ubuntu-desktop
package. When aptitude is used there is no need for this. Please follow the guide
exactly, when this guide wants to use apt-get, it will tell you Smile :)

If you run into individual dependency issues you need to resolve these
individually. You can use sudo apt-get -f install for this. And then continue by
running e.g. sudo ./feisty --frontend DistUpgradeViewTextm -mode=server. Replace
feisty with the release where you upgrade to, this will continue the
do-release-upgrade process.
