How to Manage Packages with APT on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS

   APT also known as Advanced Packaging Tool is the command-line tool for managing packages in
   Debian-based distributions like Ubuntu 16.04, Ubuntu 18.04, Debian 8, Debian 9 and much more. APT
   simplifies the process of installing, removing, upgrading packages and even used to upgrade the
   entire operating system through the Command Line Interface

   In this tutorial, we will explain how to manage packages using APT command line tool on Ubuntu 18.04
   LTS server.

Requirements
     * A server running Ubuntu 18.04 LTS.
     * A root or sudo access on the server.

   All commands below are run as root user. Either log in as root user on the shell or run:
sudo -s

   to become the root user. As an alternative, you can prepend 'sudo ' to all commands.

Install and Update Packages
   Apt-get works by obtaining information from different sources and stored in a local database. The
   update command fetched the packages from their locations and update the packages to a newer version.
apt-get update -y

   After running the above command, your database should be up-to-date.

   The upgrade command is used to upgrade all the currently installed software packages to the newer
   version.
apt-get upgrade -y

   You can also use dist-upgrade command to upgrade the packages, but it changes package dependencies
   with a smart conflict resolution method.
apt-get dist-upgrade -y

   Once your database is updated, you can install any packages by running the following command:
apt-get install package1 package2

   For example, you can install Nginx web server package by running the following command:
apt-get install nginx

   If you want to download only package file but not install it, you can run the following command:
apt-get install -d package1

   The above command will download the package file in /var/cache/apt/archives directory.

   To reinstall any package with the newer version run the following command:
apt-get install package1 --reinstall

Remove a Package with Apt
   To remove a package from your system simply run the following command:
apt-get remove package1

   The above command will only remove the package but keep the configuration file.

   To remove the package with configuration file with the following command:
apt-get purge package1

   You can also remove all unwanted packages and clean the database with the following command:
apt-get autoremove
apt-get clean

Search Package with Apt-Cache
   The command apt-cache is used to search for software packages.

   To find the package by its description, run the following command:
apt-cache search proftpd

   You should see the following output:
resource-agents - Cluster Resource Agents
fail2ban - ban hosts that cause multiple authentication errors
ftpd - File Transfer Protocol (FTP) server
gadmin-proftpd - GTK+ configuration tool for proftpd
gadmin-proftpd-dbg - GTK+ configuration tool for proftpd debug package
gadmintools - GTK+ server administration tools (meta-package)
proftpd-basic - Versatile, virtual-hosting FTP daemon - binaries
proftpd-dev - Versatile, virtual-hosting FTP daemon - development files
proftpd-doc - Versatile, virtual-hosting FTP daemon - documentation
proftpd-mod-autohost - ProFTPD module mod_autohost
proftpd-mod-case - ProFTPD module mod_case
proftpd-mod-clamav - ProFTPD module mod_clamav
proftpd-mod-dnsbl - ProFTPD module mod_dnsbl
proftpd-mod-fsync - ProFTPD module mod_fsync
proftpd-mod-geoip - Versatile, virtual-hosting FTP daemon - GeoIP module
proftpd-mod-ldap - Versatile, virtual-hosting FTP daemon - LDAP module
proftpd-mod-msg - ProFTPD module mod_msg
proftpd-mod-mysql - Versatile, virtual-hosting FTP daemon - MySQL module
proftpd-mod-odbc - Versatile, virtual-hosting FTP daemon - ODBC module
proftpd-mod-pgsql - Versatile, virtual-hosting FTP daemon - PostgreSQL module
proftpd-mod-sqlite - Versatile, virtual-hosting FTP daemon - SQLite3 module
proftpd-mod-tar - ProFTPD module mod_tar
proftpd-mod-vroot - ProFTPD module mod_vroot

   To find all the packages starting with proftpd with the following command:
apt-cache pkgnames proftpd

   You should see the following output:
apt-cache pkgnames proftpd
proftpd-mod-dnsbl
proftpd-mod-odbc
proftpd-mod-pgsql
proftpd-doc
proftpd-mod-tar
proftpd-mod-ldap
proftpd-mod-case
proftpd-mod-geoip
proftpd-mod-mysql
proftpd-basic
proftpd-mod-vroot
proftpd-mod-clamav
proftpd-mod-autohost
proftpd-mod-fsync
proftpd-mod-sqlite
proftpd-mod-msg
proftpd-dev

Description-en: small, friendly text editor inspired by Pico
 GNU nano is an easy-to-use text editor originally designed as a replacement
 for Pico, the ncurses-based editor from the non-free mailer package Pine
 (itself now available under the Apache License as Alpine).
 .
 However, nano also implements many features missing in pico, including:
  - feature toggles;
  - interactive search and replace (with regular expression support);
  - go to line (and column) command;
  - auto-indentation and color syntax-highlighting;
  - filename tab-completion and support for multiple buffers;
  - full internationalization support.

apt-get is a command line interface for retrieval of packages
and information about them from authenticated sources and
for installation, upgrade and removal of packages together
with their dependencies.

Most used commands:
  update - Retrieve new lists of packages
  upgrade - Perform an upgrade
  install - Install new packages (pkg is libc6 not libc6.deb)
  remove - Remove packages
  purge - Remove packages and config files
  autoremove - Remove automatically all unused packages
  dist-upgrade - Distribution upgrade, see apt-get(8)
  dselect-upgrade - Follow dselect selections
  build-dep - Configure build-dependencies for source packages
  clean - Erase downloaded archive files
  autoclean - Erase old downloaded archive files
  check - Verify that there are no broken dependencies
  source - Download source archives
  download - Download the binary package into the current directory
  changelog - Download and display the changelog for the given package

See apt-get(8) for more information about the available commands.
Configuration options and syntax is detailed in apt.conf(5).
Information about how to configure sources can be found in sources.list(5).
Package and version choices can be expressed via apt_preferences(5).
Security details are available in apt-secure(8).
                                        This APT has Super Cow Powers.
