If I run this command and start typing the MySQL password, the password is visible on the screen:
	ssh user@server ‘mysql -u user -p’

How can I prevent this? If I log in through SSH and execute the MySQL command, then everything works fine.
How can you keep passwords invisible when running a command as an SSH argument?

The Answer

If you provide a remote command to run, SSH does not allocate a tty, so the remote command is unable to
disable echo. You can force SSH to provide a tty using the -t option:
	ssh -t user@server ‘mysql -u user -p’
