Use arp Command on Linux with Example
November 17, 2024

How to Install and Use arp Command on Linux with Example
   The ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) is a command-line utility for Linux and other operating systems
   such as Windows and macOS. It manipulates the system's ARP cache or table. Even though modern Linux
   systems often use tools like ip or ip-neigh for similar tasks, ARP remains a helpful command for
   inspecting and managing ARP entries. It helps translate IP addresses into MAC (Media Access Control)
   addresses, ensuring the devices in the same local network can communicate.

   This article explains the Syntax of the ARP command on Linux systems such as Ubuntu, RHEL, Debian,
   and others.

   What is the use of ARP in Networking?
   Let's know precisely what the use of ARP command is in a network. As we know, the computers in a
   network are identified by two addresses: the IP address (logical address assigned to the system by
   DHCP or manually) and the MAC address (physical address of LAN or WiFi Card). Now, the work of ARP is
   to map the destination device's IP address to its MAC address whenever a device wants to communicate
   with another in the same LAN. The location where this mapping gets stored is called the ARP cache.

ARP Syntax
   The general syntax for the ARP command to perform various tasks on Linux, such as viewing the ARP
   table, adding, deleting, or modifying entries in the ARP table, and troubleshooting network
   connectivity issues.
arp [options] [hostname]

Installing the ARP Command
   Most Linux distros come with a pre-installed package called "net-tools," so we don't need to install
   it manually. However, if your Linux system doesn't already have the ARP tool, then here is the
   command to install it manually on RHEL or Debian-based Linux distros.

   On Debian/Ubuntu:
$> sudo apt update
$> sudo apt install net-tools

   On RHEL/CentOS/Orcacle, Rocky/AlmaLinux:
$> sudo dnf install net-tools

Commonly Used ARP Commands - Examples

     * View the ARP Table:
arp -a

   This command lists all ARP entries, showing the IP addresses, corresponding MAC addresses, and
   interface details.

     * Add an ARP Entry:
   Static ARP entries prevent frequent ARP requests for a known IP-MAC mapping, so if you want to do it
   manually, then here is the command:
sudo arp -s

   Example:
sudo arp -s 192.168.1.100 00:11:22:33:44:55

   Here, 192.168.1.100 is the IP address, and 00:11:22:33:44:55 is the MAC address.

     * Display Specific Entry
   If you want the system to show the ARP entry for a specific host on the terminal, then use:

   Replace [hostname] with the host's IP address or name.
arp [hostname]

     * Delete ARP Entry
   Use the ARP command with the -d option to remove the existing ARP entry from the Linux system.
$> sudo arp -d

   Example:
$> sudo arp -d 192.168.1.100

     * Limit Output to a Specific Interface:
   If your system has multiple network interfaces, you can specify the interface:
$> arp -i

   Example:
$> arp -i eth0

Modern Alternatives to ARP Command
   The arp command is considered legacy in many Linux distributions. Tools like IP provide equivalent
   functionality. Therefore, if users are looking for an alternative command to use, then the IP command
   will be an option. It is a part of the iproute2 package and provides more advanced and robust ARP
   management. Below are equivalent commands using ip:

     * View the ARP Table:
$> ip neigh show

     * Add an ARP Entry:
$> sudo ip neigh add <IP_ADDRESS> lladdr <MAC_ADDRESS> dev <INTERFACE>

   Example:
$> sudo ip neigh add 192.168.1.100 lladdr 00:11:22:33:44:55 dev eth0

     * Delete an ARP Entry:
$> sudo ip neigh del <IP_ADDRESS> dev <INTERFACE>

   Example:
$> sudo ip neigh del 192.168.1.100 dev eth0

Advantages & Limitations of the ARP Command
   Here is a list of a few key pros and cons of using the ARP command line:

   Benefits:
     * It is simple to use for basic network troubleshooting because of a dedicated command line tool
       for APT-related tasks.
     * It can be used on older and modern Linux systems, therefore offers a legacy support.
     * User-friendly options for basic operations.

   Limitations:
     * It was deprecated on modern systems in favor of IP tools.
     * Requires administrative privileges for modifying entries
     * Limited in functionality compared to modern alternatives like ip-neigh.

Understanding the ARP Table
   The ARP table consists of dynamic entries created automatically by ARP requests and time out after
   inactivity. In contrast, static entries are those added to the system manually and persist until
   explicitly removed or the system restarts.

   We can verify the ARP table by inspecting the ARP file /proc/net/arp :
$> cat /proc/net/arp

   Conclusion
   Although there is an alternative to the ARP command utility, it remains a handy tool for managing ARP
   entries on Linux because of its simplicity and ability to help troubleshoot network issues. Hence, it
   has become valuable to a network administrator's toolkit. After understanding the usage of ARP,
   advanced and even beginner users can diagnose connectivity problems and manage network configurations
   to ensure stable communication within their network.
