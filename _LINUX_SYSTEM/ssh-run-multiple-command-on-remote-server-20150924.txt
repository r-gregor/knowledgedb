How To SSH Run Multiple Command On Remote Machine And Exit Safely

I have a backup sync program on local server. I have an ssh password less login set up, and I can run
commands on an external server in bash script doing:
ssh root@server2 "sync; sync; /sbin/shutdown -h now"

How do I run multiple commands in bash on a remote Unix or Linux server? What is the best Way to SSH in
and Run various unix commands in bash?

There are various ways to run multiple commands on a remote Unix server. The syntax is as follows:
Simple bash syntax to run multiple commands on remote machine

Simply run command2 if command1 successful on a remote host called foo
$ ssh bar@foo "command1 && command2"

Run date and hostname commands:
$ ssh user@host "date && hostname"

You can run sudo command as follows on a remote box called server1.cyberciti.biz:
$ ssh -t vivek@server1.cyberciti.biz "sudo /sbin/shutdown -h now"

And, finally:
$ ssh root@server1.cyberciti.biz "sync && sync && /sbin/shutdown -h now"

Bash here document syntax

The here document syntax tells the shell to read input from the current source (HERE) until a line
containing only word (HERE) is seen:


ssh server1 << HERE
 command1
 command2
HERE

Here is another example to run a multiple commands on a remote system:


ssh vivek@server1.cyberciti.biz << EOF
 date
 hostname
 cat /etc/resolv.conf
EOF

With sudo command type:


ssh -t vivek@server1.cyberciti.biz << EOF
 sync
 sync
 sudo /sbin/shutdown -h 0
EOF

Pipe script to a remote server

Finally, create a script called "remote-box-commands.bash" as follows on your local server:

date
hostname
cat /etc/resolv.conf

Run it as follows on a remote server called nas02nixcrafthomeserver:
$ cat remote-box-commands.bash | ssh user@nas02nixcrafthomeserver

OR
cat remote-box-commands.bash | ssh -t vivek@nas02nixcrafthomeserver

Please note that the -t option will get rid of "Sorry, you must have a tty to run sudo/insert
your-command-here" error message. For more info see your ssh and bash command man page.

SUDO will not work inside EOF unless it is set up with the NOPASSWD option in sudoers, because your
STDIN is not a standard terminal.

The correct format would be.

ssh server sudo -S shutdown <<EOF
SUDOPASSWORD
EOF
-S will instruct sudo to get the password from STDIN (in this case the EOF) instead of a terminal. One
disadvantage to this is your password will be captured in your session logs if it is set up. You can
avoid that by running it inside a script.

For SSH connections where a password is needed, use sshpass.
For example:

SSHPASS="password"
SSHCOMMAND="ssh -p 22 -T -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -o BatchMode=no"
SSHACCOUNT="xyz@abc.com"
sshpass -p "$SSHPASS" $SSHCOMMAND $SSHACCOUNT << EOF_run_commands
uptime

For more complex tasks, put a script in a file, scp, ssh to execute the script , then remove the file

For more complicated tasks use Ansible.

In fact even for non complicated tasks use Ansible; It is essentially Bash & SSH on steroids.
