2.7.16. Recording and copying system configuration

You can make a local copy of the package and debconf selection states by the following.

# dpkg --get-selections '*' > selection.dpkg
# debconf-get-selections    > selection.debconf
Here, "*" makes "selection.dpkg" to include package entries for "purge" too.

You can transfer these 2 files to another computer, and install there with the following.

# dselect update
# debconf-set-selections < myselection.debconf
# dpkg --set-selections  < myselection.dpkg
# apt-get -u dselect-upgrade    # or dselect install
If you are thinking about managing many servers in a cluster with practically the same configuration, you should consider to use specialized package such as fai to manage the whole system.
