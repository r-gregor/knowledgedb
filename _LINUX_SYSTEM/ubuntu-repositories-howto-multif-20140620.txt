What are Repositories?

   There are literally thousands of Ubuntu programs available to meet the needs of Ubuntu
   users. Many of these programs are stored in software archives commonly referred to as
   repositories. Repositories make it very easy to install new software onto Ubuntu using an
   Internet connection, while also providing a high level of security, as each program
   available in the repositories is thoroughly tested and built specifically for each version
   of Ubuntu.

   The Ubuntu software repositories are organized into four separate areas or "components",
   according to the level of support offered by Ubuntu and whether or not the program in
   question complies with Ubuntu's [149]Free Software Philosophy.

   The repository components are:
     * Main - Officially supported software.
     * Restricted - Supported software that is not available under a completely free license.
     * Universe - Community maintained software, i.e. not officially supported software.
     * Multiverse - Software that is not free.

   For more information regarding the Ubuntu Repository components, [150]click here.

   The Ubuntu Install CDs contain software from the "Main" and "Restricted" components of the
   repositories. Once your system is made aware of the Internet-based locations for these
   repositories, many more software programs are available for installation. By using the
   software package management tools already installed on your system, you can search for,
   install and update any piece of software directly over the Internet, without the need for
   the CD.

Adding Repositories in Ubuntu

   This section describes how to manage software repositories in the currently supported
   Ubuntu releases. For Kubuntu please see [151]Kubuntu repository management.
     * The operations described on this page modify the software repositories configuration
       file located at
/etc/apt/sources.list

   info3.png Software sources can also be managed by making direct modifications to this file
   using the command line. If you prefer to use the command line instead of a graphical user
   interface, see [152]Managing Repositories from the Command Line instead.

   GUI-based repository management is normally accomplished via "Software Sources". This
   interface can be accessed via several methods. For the latest versions of Ubuntu, the
   easiest way is to go through the "Ubuntu Software Center". Open the software center, then
   from the Edit menu select "Software Sources". You will have to enter your password to
   change settings in this window.

   For older versions of ubuntu, there are several options:
     * Main Menu: System > Administration > Software Sources.
     * Synaptic : System > Administration > Synaptic Package Manager : >> Settings >>
       Repositories.
     * Main Menu: Ubuntu Software Center : >> Edit, Software Sources.

Adding Ubuntu Software Repositories

   The "Ubuntu Software" tab displays a list of repositories or "Channels".

   info3.png For a detailed description of these repositories, visit this Ubuntu [153]page.
     * The following repositories are enabled by default:
          + "Canonical-supported Open Source software (main)"
          + "Proprietary drivers for devices (restricted)" [hardware-dependent]
          + "Source Code"
          + Note: In Ubuntu 9.04 (Jaunty) and later, the main, universe, restricted and
            multiverse repositories are enabled by default.
     * Select other repositories to gain access to proprietary drivers, copyrighted material,
       source code, etc.
          + "Community-maintained Open Source software - (universe)"
          + "Proprietary drivers for devices (restricted)" - Commonly used software which is
            not available under a completely free license. This software is supported by the
            Ubuntu team.
          + "Software restricted by copyright or legal issues (multiverse)" - Software that is
            "not free" and may require licensing. This software is not supported.
     * Select "Close" to save your changes. A dialog box should appear, asking whether you'd
       like to update the list of repositories. Select "Reload" to update the list.
       Repobuttons.png

   The Close, Reload, and Revert buttons each perform special functions with regard to the
   repository pages.
     * Close. The 'Close' button must be selected to execute any change(s). If the action
       would change system files, they are written at this time.
     * Reload. Any time a setting is changed which alters a repository setting the 'Reload'
       button should be selected to allow the applicable repository database to be updated.
       Repository information will not normally be updated until the 'Reload' button is
       selected. If you do not wish to use 'Reload', select 'Close' to exit without updating
       the database.
     * Revert. The 'Revert' button erases changes made since the last save. It merely cancels
       pending changes which have not been executed, returning the selections to their prior
       state. The button does not return system files to the original installation settings.

Download Server

   The repository server is accessed from this page. If you have problems connecting to a
   server, the server is slow, you cannot find a package you expect to find on the
   currently-selected server, or simply want to find a faster server, click on the "Download
   from" window. Options include:
     * "Main Server", "Server for ...", or "Other".
       SoftwareSources-Server.png
     * Selecting "Other" provides the following options:
          + The opportunity to select a participating server anywhere in the world.
               o Expand any of the country listings in the left pane and highlight a server.
                 Then select "Choose Server".
          + Best Server.
               o When selected, the system pings each of the available worldwide servers and
                 determines the best one to use at the present time. At the end of the test
                 the best-performing server is highlighted in the left pane. To enable that
                 server, select "Choose server".
               o The server will remain the default server until changed. Download speeds are
                 not automatically rechecked, so the selected server may not be the "Best
                 Server" at a anothrer time.
       SoftwareSources-ChooseServer.png

CD-ROM/DVD

   The install CD-ROM may be selected or deselected from this window.
     * Software Sources.png
     * If selected, the system will attempt to search the CD-ROM during package installs.
     * If selected but the CD is not inserted, a message will be generated requesting it's
       insertion.
     * Deselect the CD-ROM if you do not plan to use it to install software. This will also
       end messages to insert the CD-ROM during internet installs.

Third-Party Software Tab

Adding Canonical Partner Repositories

   The "Third-Party Software" tab is where you will be able to add the Canonical Partner
   Repositories. You will see two Canonical Partner repositories listed - one for applications
   and another for source code (src). The partner repositories offer access to proprietary and
   closed-source software and are not enabled by default. Users must specifically enable these
   'partner' repositories. Select "Close" and "Reload" to save and update the database if you
   chose to add either or both of them.
     * SoftwareSources-Partner.png

CD-ROM/DVD

   Other CD-ROM/DVD sources may be added on this tab. Click the "Add CD-ROM" button after
   inserting a CD-ROM containing packages. After adding the CD-ROM/DVD, it will be searched
   for packages during installation requests.

Adding PPAs

   Since Ubuntu 9.10, there is an easy way to add Personal Package Archives to the software
   sources that automatically imports the keys to verify the downloaded software.

   Warning.png PPA's do not undergo the same process of validation as packages in the main
   ubuntu repositories. PPA keys are cryptographically signed but are still a low security
   alternative to the main repository and so the user will be installing software at their own
   risk.

   As described [154]above, go to Ubuntu Software Centre > Edit > Software Sources > Other
   Software and click Add. You can then type in an APT line in PPA form, like
   ppa:[username]/[ppaname].
     * Add-PPA.png

   After clicking Add Source and Close, you have to Reload the software sources. You can then
   install packages from that PPA in the Software Center.

Adding PPA through commandline

   If you're using the most recent version of Ubuntu (or any version from Ubuntu 9.10
   onwards), you can add a PPA to your system with a single line in your terminal.

   Make sure you have the package python-software-properties installed.

   Step 1: On the PPA's overview page, look for the heading that reads Adding this PPA to your
   system. Make a note of the PPA's location, which looks like (for example):

   ppa:gwibber-daily/ppa

   Step 2: Open a terminal and enter:

   $ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:user/ppa-name

   Replace 'ppa:user/ppa-name' with the PPA's location that you noted above.

   Your system will now fetch the PPA's key. This enables your Ubuntu system to verify that
   the packages in the PPA have not been interfered with since they were built.

   Step 3: Now, as a one-off, you should tell your system to pull down the latest list of
   software from each archive it knows about, including the PPA you just added:

   $ sudo apt-get update

   Now you're ready to start installing software from the PPA!

Adding Other Repositories

   Warning.png There are times when you might want to add non-Ubuntu repositories to your list
   of software sources. Make sure that all repositories you add in this way have been tested
   and are known to work on Ubuntu systems. Repositories that are not designed to work with
   your version of Ubuntu can introduce inconsistencies in your system and might force you to
   re-install.

   For example, some software cannot be distributed by Ubuntu due to patent and licensing
   restrictions in some countries (see the [155]RestrictedFormats page for examples). You
   might want to add repositories that offer such software.

   To add additional repositories, click the "Add" button, and enter the location of the
   repository in the window.

     * SoftwareSources-AddApt2.png
     * Enter the apt line into the dialog box. It should look something like this:
deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/fta/ubuntu raring main

   info3.png For an explanation of the different parts of the apt line, see the [156]Editing
   Repositories section below.

   idea.png Some web sites provide instructions on how to add their repositories to each
   version of Ubuntu.

   idea.png You can also download an official repository for your machine architecture (i.e.
   i386) and use it offline (see [157]AptGet/Offline/Repository).

Editing Repositories

   To make changes to a software source, select it in the list and click the Edit button. A
   dialog box displays the apt line, broken up into its components.
     * SoftwareSources-EditSource.png
     * Type Software sources are designated as "binary" (deb) for software in binary format or
       "Source" (src) for source code format. Select the option that corresponds to the
       repository.
     * URI Enter a valid Uniform Resource Indicator or URI for the software repository. Here's
       a list of examples:
          + cdrom
cdrom:[description_of_cd]/
          + ftp
ftp://ftp.domain.ext/path/to/repository
          + http
http://www.domain.ext/path/to/repository
          + smb (works only when the computer is connected to a Samba share)
smb://path/to/repository
          + nfs (works only if the computer is connected to a NFS share)
file://path/to/local/directory
     * Distribution
       Select the name of the distribution or the name of the distribution version.
       (raring [158]in the example above.)
     * Components
       Select the repository section to access. Add more sections separated by spaces.
       (The [159]example repository has a partner section.)
     * Comment
       Add a comment to describe the repository for easier reference.

Removing & Disabling Repositories

     * SoftwareSources-OtherSoftware.png
     * To disable a repository temporarily, untick the checkbox next to the source. The user
       can restore the repository by selecting it.
     * To remove a software repository ("Channel") permanently from the list, highlight the
       repository and click on the "Remove" button.

Updates Tab

     * SoftwareSources-Updates.png

   The "Updates" tab is where you will be able to set when and how Ubuntu receives system
   updates.

Ubuntu Updates

     * "Important Security Updates (raring-security)". Patches for security vulnerabilities in
       Ubuntu packages. They are managed by the Ubuntu Security Team and are designed to
       change the behavior of the package as little as possible -- in fact, the minimum
       required to resolve the security problem. As a result, they tend to be very low-risk to
       apply and all users are urged to apply security updates.
     * "Recommended Updates (raring-updates)". Updates for serious bugs in Ubuntu packaging
       that do not affect the security of the system.
     * "Pre-released Updates (raring-proposed)". The testing area for updates. This repository
       is recommended only to those interested in helping to test updates and provide
       feedback.
     * "Unsupported Updates (raring-backports)". As the name states, these are unsupported new
       versions of packages which have been backported to an older release. Packages may
       contain new features, may introduce new interfaces, and bugs.
       For more information on backports, visit [160]UbuntuBackports

Automatic Updates

   This section allows the user to set the frequency and manner of updates. If the 'Check for
   updates' box is not selected no other options in this section may be set.

Release Updates

   Allows users to upgrade to new versions of Ubuntu.
     * "Normal Releases" - Allows an upgrade from one regular release to another, such as from
       Ubuntu 12.10 (Quantal Quetzal) to Ubuntu 13.04 (Raring Ringtail).
     * "Long Term Support Releases Only" - Allows an upgrade between Long Term Support
       releases, such as from Ubuntu 10.04 (Lucid Lynx) LTS to Ubuntu 12.04 (Precise Pangolin)
       LTS but not to other distributions which were not designated Long Term Support
       releases.

   If you made any changes don't forget to "Close" and "Reload" so the repositories will be
   updated.

Authentication Tab

     * SoftwareSources-Authentication.png

   "Authentication keys" are usually obtained from the maintainer of the software repository.
   The maintainer will often place a copy of the authentication key on a public key server
   such as www.keyserver.net, but you need the "key hash" to find it. For instance, in the
   image above, the fourth entry is the PPA for Mozilla Team. If you go to its web page
   ([161]https://launchpad.net/~mozillateam/+archive/ppa), you'll find the text snippet
   "Signing key: 1024R/CE49EC21"; the latter part of this is the key hash (CE49EC21).

   Once the key hash is known, the key can then be retrieved using the command:
     *
gpg --keyserver [name of keyserver] --recv-keys [keyhash]
     * For instance, you could import the maintainer's authentication key, whose hash is
       CE49EC21, as follows:
gpg --keyserver subkeys.pgp.net --recv-keys CE49EC21
     * Then, add the key to Ubuntu's apt trusted keys database with the following command:
gpg --export --armor CE49EC21 | sudo apt-key add -
     * Note there's a dash at the end of the line

   info3.png For more on apt and authentication keys, see [162]SecureApt.

Finding a key hash

   (Missing section)

Statistics

     * SoftwareSources-Statistics.png

   The Statistics tab is provided for those users who wish to provide data anonymously to the
   Ubuntu project. Information collected and reported include such items as application
   installation and usage.

Integration with Ubuntu Software Center

     * UbuntuSoftwareCenter.png

   Ubuntu Software Center, which originated with Ubuntu 9.10, is the GUI-based method to add
   both free and non-free applications and replaces the Add/Remove feature of earlier Ubuntu
   releases. It allows the user to selectively choose the repositories to be searched and then
   presents a list applications with brief descriptions of each program.

   Open the application directly from the Main Menu - the Software Center has it's own
   listing.

   The left panel displays the enabled repositories. The right panel lists the applications
   available from the selected repository.
     * With Get Software highlighted in the left pane, the applications contained in all the
       repositories listed in the left pane are displayed in the right panel.
     * If an individual repository is highlighted in the left panel, only those applications
       from the selected repository are displayed on the right.
       SoftwareCenter-Repositories.png

   Software Sources is accessible from the Software Center via the Edit, Software Sources menu
   (see below left).

   The contents of Software Center are updated whenever a repository is added, deleted or
   changed via Software Sources. While the repository list is updating the progress icon is
   displayed in the left panel of Software Center (see below right).
     *

       SoftwareCenter-Sources1.png
       SoftwareCenter-Update1.png

Exploring the Repositories

   There are several gui-based methods you can use to explore the repositories. One is to open
   Synaptic and click on the Origin button. This will display a repository list in the window
   above the button. The list will contain all the repositories enabled in your sources.list.
   To the right will be the packages available via download (white boxes) and currently
   installed packages (green boxes).

   There are two images of the main Synaptic page below. The first, on the left, shows the
   results of selecting local/main. Local packages are packages stored on the user's computer.
   The second example, on the right, displays the results of selecting the Ubuntu main online
   repository.

   softwaresources.packages1.png

   If you highlight a package and select Properties in the top menu you may be able to
   determine the repository origin in the Section: area.

   properties.png

   You can check the information in Section: for repository information. If it is listed, the
   repository will be listed in parentheses. If there is more than one repository in the
   sources.list with that ending (for instance nonfree) you will have to look at the
   Maintainer area to try to determine which specific repository is the source.]

   Another method to find a package's repository is to visit [163]http://packages.ubuntu.com/.
   The search box is an easy method to quickly locate a package maintained by the Ubuntu team.
   Several input selections are available to help the user refine the search.

   For packages not included in the supported Ubuntu repositories, an internet search using
   the package name and "deb" may be successful.

   IconsPage/terminal.png This page describes how to manage software [31]repositories from the
   command line. (GUI tools are also available: [32]Managing Repositories in Ubuntu or
   [33]Kubuntu).

   IconsPage/important.png If you are using a minimal install or server install you will need
   to be familiar with a terminal based text editor like [34]nano. If you are using a GUI
   install you can use Nano or GEdit.

The Basics

   Ubuntu uses [35]apt for package management. Apt stores a list of repositories or software
   channels in the file
/etc/apt/sources.list

   By editing this file from the command line, we can add, remove, or temporarily disable
   software repositories.
     * IconsPage/note.png Note: It's always a good idea to backup a configuration file like
       sources.list before you edit it. To do so, issue the following command:
sudo cp /etc/apt/sources.list /etc/apt/sources.list.backup

   Typically, the beginning of the file /etc/apt/sources.list looks like this:

# sources.list
#deb cdrom:[Ubuntu 13.10 _Saucy Salamander_ - Release i386 (20131016.1)]/ saucy main restricted

# See http://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes for how to upgrade to
# newer versions of the distribution.
deb http://ch.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ saucy main restricted
deb-src http://ch.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ saucy main restricted
#...

Explanation of the Repository Format

     * All the lines beginning with one or two hashes (#) are comments, for information only.
     * The lines without hashes are apt repository lines. Here's what they say:
          + deb: These repositories contain binaries or precompiled packages. These
            repositories are required for most users.
          + deb-src: These repositories contain the source code of the packages. Useful for
            developers.
          + [36]http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu: The URI (Uniform Resource Identifier), in
            this case a location on the internet. See the [37]official mirror list or the
            self-maintained [38]mirror list to find other mirrors.
          + saucy is the release name or version of your distribution.
          + main & restricted are the section names or [39]components. There can be several
            section names, separated by spaces.

Other Versions

     * IconsPage/note.png For other [40]Ubuntu releases you would replace the 'saucy' with the
       current version you have installed ('precise', 'quantal', 'raring', 'saucy', 'trusty',
       ...) Type lsb_release -sc to find out your release.

Adding Repositories

Adding the Universe and Multiverse Repositories

   Additional software repositories such as [41]Universe and Multiverse can be enabled by
   uncommenting the corresponding apt lines (i.e. delete the '#' at the beginning of the
   line). For Universe, uncomment those lines:
     *
deb http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ saucy universe
deb-src http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ saucy universe
deb http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ saucy-updates universe
deb-src http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ saucy-updates universe

   There are four similar lines for 'multiverse'.

   OR you may use the add-apt-repository command. If your release is 'saucy':
     *
sudo add-apt-repository "deb http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ saucy universe multiverse"
sudo add-apt-repository "deb http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ saucy-updates universe multiverse"

   IconsPage/note.png Depending on your location, you should replace 'us.' by another country
   code, referring to a mirror server in your region. Check sources.list to see what is used!

   Type lsb_release -sc to find out your release. You may repeat the commands with "deb-src"
   instead of "deb" in order to install the source files.

   Don't forget to retrieve the updated package lists:
     *
sudo apt-get update

Adding Partner Repositories

   You can add the partner repositories by uncommenting the following lines in your
   /etc/apt/sources.list file:
     *
deb http://archive.canonical.com/ubuntu saucy partner
deb-src http://archive.canonical.com/ubuntu saucy partner

   Then update as before:
     *
sudo apt-get update
       IconsPage/important.png Be aware that the software contained within this repository is
       NOT open source.

Adding Other Repositories

   There are some reasons for which you might want to add non-Ubuntu repositories to your list
   of software sources. Caution: To avoid trouble with your sytem, only add repositories that
   are trustworthy and that are known to work on Ubuntu systems!
     ______________________________________________________________________________________

     * You can add custom software repositories by adding the apt repository line of your
       software source to the end of the sources.list file. It should look something like
       this:
deb http://mirror3.ubuntulinux.nl/ hardy-seveas freenx
     * Don't forget to make apt aware of your changes:
sudo apt-get update

Adding Launchpad PPA Repositories

   Adding Launchpad PPA (Personal Package Archive) is possible conveniently via the command:
   add-apt-repository. This command is similar to "addrepo" on Debian.
     * The command updates your sources.list file. Type man add-apt-repository for detailed
       help.
     * If a public key is required and available it is automatically downloaded and
       registered.
     * Should be installed by default. On older or minimal Ubuntu releases, you may have to
       install software-properties-common and/or python-software-properties first (sudo
       apt-get install python-software-properties)
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:<repository-name>
       Example: sudo add-apt-repository ppa:nhandler

Enabling Repositories with a (non-interactive) Script

   IconsPage/note.png This section seemed obsolete due to the add-apt-repository command, thus
   it has been removed.

Suggestions & Recommendations

     * It is always a good idea to back up configuration files like /etc/apt/sources.list
       before you begin editing. You can then revert your changes if needed.
     * If you decide to add other repositories to sources.list, make sure that the repository
       is meant to work (and known to work) with Ubuntu. Repositories that are not designed to
       work with your version of Ubuntu can introduce inconsistencies in your system and might
       force you to re-install. Also, make sure that you really need to add external
       repositories as the software package(s) you are looking for may already have been
       introduced into the official repositories!
     * Please keep in mind that it may not be legal to enable some non-Ubuntu software
       repositories in some countries.
     * You may be asked enter a security key when adding a non-Ubuntu repository to your
       sources. See [42]Managing Authentication Keys for instructions.
     * Remember to retrieve updated package lists by issuing a sudo apt-get update when you're
       done editing sources.list.
