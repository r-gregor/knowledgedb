Wake Your Linux PC From Suspend With a USB Mouse or Keyboard

   Here's how to ensure a mouse click or keyboard tap wakes your Linux PC.

   While booting your PC with the power button might be reliable, it isn't the most convenient or
   ergonomic solution for many users. One of the best alternatives is using your keyboard or mouse to
   boot your PC.

   On the surface, it might seem like most Linux distributions don't support this convenient setting.
   It's easy to wonder: is there any possible way to enable waking with USB devices? On distributions
   like Ubuntu and Debian, enabling wake from USB only takes a few simple steps.

Determine What USB Devices You Will Use
   Before changing any settings, you should think about what USB devices you would like to use to wake
   your PC. Most people like to use their keyboard. Using your mouse is also a good option, but it's
   worth noting that mouses are known to be very finicky. They can wake some PCs with the smallest
   movements.

   In most cases, you shouldn't enable all devices and ports for wakeup. While this won't directly cause
   any issues, it does increase the likelihood that one of your USB devices might cause unwanted waking
   behavior.

   Once you've decided what USB devices you would like to use to wake your PC, you will need to get more
   information about each device by entering the following command in the Terminal.
$> lsusb

   After you hit enter, the Terminal will print a list of all USB devices, including their names, bus
   numbers, device numbers, and ID numbers. Look through the list until you find the correct USB
   device. Write down the bus number and the last four digits of the ID number for each device you
   intend to use to wake your PC.

Enable USB Ports During Suspend
   Next, you will need to confirm that the ports your USB devices are connected to are enabled for
   wakeup. Start by finding the port that each USB device is plugged into by entering the following
   command. Replace IDNUM with the last four digits of your USB device's ID number.
 grep IDNUM /sys/bus/usb/devices/*/idProduct

   Output:
   <user>@<host> $> lsusb
   ...
   Bus 002 ...
   Bus 001 Device 008: ID 1a2c:0027 China Resource Semico Co., LTD USB Kexboard
   Bus 001 ...
   Bus 001 Device 006: ID 0000:3825 USB OPTICAL MOUSE
   ...

   <user>@<host> $> grep 0027 /sys/bus/usb/devices/*/idProduct
   /sys/bus/usb/devices/1-5.4/idProduct:0027


   The system will print the bus and port that each USB device is plugged into (see above). Note that
   the directory path printed shows that the keyboard (0027) for this PC is device 1-5.4.

   Next, determine if wakeup is enabled on the ports that your USB devices use by entering the following
   command. Check the port for every device that you intend to use. Replace PORTNUM with the port number
   (for example: 2-01 or 3-14).
$> cat /sys/bus/usb/devices/PORTNUM/power/wakeup

   Output:
   <user>@<host> $> lsusb
   ...
   Bus 002 ...
   Bus 001 Device 008: ID 1a2c:0027 China Resource Semico Co., LTD USB Kexboard
   Bus 001 ...
   Bus 001 Device 006: ID 0000:3825 USB OPTICAL MOUSE
   ...

   <user>@<host> $> grep 0027 /sys/bus/usb/devices/*/idProduct
   /sys/bus/usb/devices/1-5.4/idProduct:0027

   <user>@<host> $> cat /sys/bus/usb/devices/1-5.4/power/wakeup
   disabled


   After entering the command, the system will print whether the specified port has wakeup enabled or
   disabled (see above). If any ports have wakeup disabled, use the following command to edit the file
   and change wakeup to enabled. Enter your password if prompted. Finally, save and exit the file.
$> sudo nano sys/bus/usb/devices/PORTNUM/power/wakeup

Configure A Wakeup Rule For Your USB Device
   After enabling wakeup on your computer's ports, you will need to enable wakeup for your USB devices.
   You can do this by opening the device wakeup configuration file with the following command. Replace
   USBNUM with the correct name for your USB device. Ex., Bus 001 = usb1, Bus 003 = usb3.
$> sudo nano /sys/bus/usb/devices/USBNUM/power/wakeup

   The file will display whether wakeup is enabled or disabled for the specified device. Change disabled
   to enabled, and then save and exit the file. Repeat this process for each device you intend to use to
   wake your computer from suspend by changing the USBNUM each time.

Configure Your New Settings to Persist After Reboots
   Finally, you will need to configure your PC so that your new settings persist after each reboot. You
   should start by opening the configuration file with the following command.

   Output:
   $> sudo nano /etc/rc.local

   GNU nano 6.4
   echo enabled > /sys/bus/usb/devices/1-5.4/power/wakeup
   echo enabled > /sys/bus/usb/devices/usb1/power/wakeup


   Once the file has been opened (see above), you will need to scroll until you find the section of the
   file just after the comments and before exit 0. Select the space between the comments and exit 0 to
   add a line for each port and device you intend to use. If the file is empty, simply select the file
   and add the new configurations to the first line.
echo enabled > /sys/bus/usb/devices/PORTNUM/power/wakeup
echo enabled > /sys/bus/usb/devices/USBNUM/power/wakeup

   It's important to note that the settings will only work exactly as you specified. If you decide to
   start using a new USB device or a different port with your PC, you may need to adjust your wakeup
   configurations to ensure that the new devices work properly.

Verify That BIOS Allows USB Wakeup
   Finally, you should make sure that your PC's BIOS is configured to allow wake from USB. You can check
   whether this is the case by restarting your computer and using the correct BIOS keys to interrupt
   the boot process.

   After loading BIOS, you will need to navigate to the advanced settings or power management menu. The
   location of the wake from USB setting may vary depending on your PC. Once you find the setting,
   enable wake from USB (see above) and boot your computer.

Enjoy Your Convenient New System Configuration
   There's no need to worry about annoying boot processes and poor ergonomics when you configure your PC
   in the right way. Wake from USB is one of the best settings you can use to make starting your PC as
   convenient as it can possibly be. There are plenty of other tips to help you do so on Linux machines.
