Reversing 'git add' Before Commit: A Step-by-Step Guide
April 21, 2023

   As developers, we've all experienced the moment when we accidentally add a file to the staging area
   using 'git add' and realize that we need to undo this action. Fortunately, Git provides an easy way
   to reverse this operation. In this article, we'll walk through a step-by-step guide on how to unstage
   files in Git before committing your changes.

   Before diving into the solution, it's crucial to understand the concept of the Git staging area. When
   you make changes to your project files, Git tracks these changes. To commit these changes to the
   repository, you need to add them to the staging area. This is done using the 'git add' command. The
   staging area serves as an intermediate space between your working directory and the repository,
   allowing you to selectively choose the changes you want to commit.

Step 1: Check the Current Git Status
   To view the current status of your Git repository, use the 'git status' command. This will display
   the changes that have been made to the working directory, as well as the changes that have been
   staged for the next commit. This information is crucial to help you identify the files you want to
   unstage.
$> git status

Step 2: Unstage (Reverse) a Single File
   To unstage a file that has been added to the staging area, use the 'git restore --staged' command,
   followed by the file path. This command will remove the specified file from the staging area, leaving
   the working directory unchanged.
$> git restore --staged <file-path>

   For example, if you have a file named 'myfile.txt' that you want to unstage, the command would be:
$> git restore --staged myfile.txt

Step 3: Unstage (Reverse) All Files
   If you want to reverse 'git add' for all files that have been added to the staging area, you can use
   the 'git restore --staged' command with a period (.) as the argument. This will unstage all files in
   your working directory, effectively resetting the staging area.
$> git restore --staged .

   Keep in mind that this command will only unstage the files, and it will not affect any changes made
   to the working directory.

Step 4: Verify the Changes
   After running the 'git restore --staged .' command, use the 'git status' command once again to verify
   that all files have been removed from the staging area. The output should show that no files are
   staged for the next commit.
$> git status

   By following these steps, you can easily reverse 'git add' for a single file or all files in your Git
   repository before committing your changes.

Conclusion
   Reversing 'git add' before committing is a simple process that every developer should know. The 'git
   restore --staged' command is a powerful tool that allows you to unstage files quickly and easily,
   helping you maintain a clean and organized Git repository. Remember to always double-check your
   staging area with the 'git status' command before committing your changes to avoid any unwanted
   additions to your repository.
