Cleaning up merged git branches: a one-liner from the CIA's leaked dev docs
20 Feb 2026

   In 2017, WikiLeaks published Vault7 - a large cache of CIA hacking tools and internal documents.
   Buried among the exploits and surveillance tools was something far more mundane: a page of
   internal developer documentation with git tips and tricks.

   Most of it is fairly standard stuff, amending commits, stashing changes, using bisect. But one tip
   has lived in my ~/.zshrc ever since.

The Problem
   Over time, a local git repo accumulates stale branches. Every feature branch, hotfix, and experiment
   you've ever merged sits there doing nothing. git branch starts to look like a graveyard.

   You can list merged branches with:
$> git branch --merged

   But deleting them one by one is tedious. The CIA's dev team has a cleaner solution:

The original command
$> git branch --merged | grep -v "\*\|master" | xargs -n 1 git branch -d

   How it works:
     * git branch --merged - lists all local branches that have already been merged into the current
       branch
     * grep -v "\*\|master" - filters out the current branch (*) and master so you don't delete either
     * xargs -n 1 git branch -d - deletes each remaining branch one at a time, safely (lowercase -d
       won't touch unmerged branches)

The updated command
   Since most projects now use main instead of master, you can update the command and exclude any other
   branches you frequently use:
$> git branch --merged origin/main | grep -vE "^\s*(\*|main|develop)" | xargs -n 1 git branch -d

   Run this from main after a deployment and your branch list goes from 40 entries back down to a
   handful.

   I keep this as a git alias so I don't have to remember the syntax:
$> alias ciaclean='git branch --merged origin/main | grep -vE "^\s*(\*|main|develop)" | \
	xargs -n 1 git branch -d'

   Then in your repo just run:
$> ciaclean

   Small thing, but one of those commands that quietly saves a few minutes every week and keeps me
   organised.
