How To Rename a Local and Remote Git Branch
July 20, 2024

   Renaming a Git branch is a common task for developers when they need to update branch names to better
   reflect their purpose or correct naming errors. This process involves changing the branch name
   locally and ensuring the changes are mirrored on the remote repository. Properly renaming branches
   helps maintain an organized and understandable project structure, which is crucial for collaborative
   development.

   This guide will walk you through the steps to rename a local and remote Git branch using the
   command-line terminal. You will learn how to rename your branch locally, push the changes to the
   remote repository, and clean up any outdated references.

Rename a Local Branch in Git
Switch to the Local Branch You Want to Rename
   To begin renaming a local branch in Git, you must first switch to the branch you intend to rename.
   This step is crucial as Git requires you to be on the branch you want to modify. Execute the
   following command:
$> git checkout old_branch_name

   Here, the old_branch_name should be replaced with the current name of the branch you wish to rename.
   This command switches your working directory to the specified branch.

Rename the Local Branch
   Once on the appropriate branch, the next step involves renaming it. For this, use the git branch
   command and the -m flag, which signifies 'move' or 'rename'. The command format is:
$> git branch -m new_branch_name

   In this command, replace new_branch_name with your chosen new branch name. This will effectively
   change the branch's name in your local repository.

Rename a Different Branch (Optional)
   If your objective is to rename a branch different from the one you're currently on, Git accommodates
   this with a slightly altered command:
$> git branch -m old-branch-name new-branch-name

   Here, old_branch_name is the branch you want to rename, and new_branch_name is the new name you
   assign to it. This command allows for renaming without the need to switch branches.

Using the -M Flag (Optional)
   Alternatively, Git provides the -M flag for renaming. This flag functions similarly to -m but also
   forcibly moves the HEAD to the new branch. This is particularly useful if you've already checked out
   the branch you're renaming. The command syntax is:
$> git branch -M new-branch-name

   This command renames the current branch and relocates the HEAD to the newly named branch,
   consolidating two actions into one.

Verify the Renaming Was Successful
   To ensure that the renaming process has been completed successfully, it's essential to verify the
   changes. You can list all the branches, including both local and remote, using:
$> git branch -a

   This command displays all branches in your repository. Look through the list to find your newly
   renamed branch and confirm the successful renaming. This step is crucial for maintaining accuracy and
   consistency in your repository management.

Rename a Remote Git Branch
Delete the Old Remote Branch
   Initially, renaming a remote Git branch involves removing the existing branch from the remote
   repository. This is a critical step, as Git does not have a direct rename command for remote
   branches. To delete the old remote branch, use:
$> git push origin --delete old_branch_name

   In this command, replace old_branch_name with the name of the remote branch you intend to remove.
   This action will delete the specified branch from the remote repository, allowing for the new branch
   name.

Create a New Remote Branch with the Desired Name
   Following deleting the old branch, the next step is to create a new branch with your preferred name
   and push it to the remote repository. This is achieved with the following command:
$> git push origin new_branch_name

   Here, new_branch_name is the name you wish to give to your new remote branch. This command pushes a
   local branch to the remote repository, creating a new branch with the specified name.

Set the Upstream Branch (Optional)
   For a more streamlined workflow, especially when planning to regularly synchronize the local and
   remote branches, setting the upstream branch is advisable. To set the upstream branch for your new
   remote branch, use:
$> git push -u origin new-branch-name

   This command not only creates a new_branch_name on the remote repository but also sets it as the
   upstream branch for the corresponding local branch. The -u flag in this command is crucial as it
   establishes a link between your local branch and the newly created remote branch, facilitating future
   pushes and pulls.

Conclusion
   By following the steps outlined in this guide, you can efficiently rename your Git branches both
   locally and remotely. Properly managing branch names not only helps keep your project organized but
   also enhances collaboration within your development team. With these skills, you can ensure a clear
   and consistent branch structure in all your Git projects.
