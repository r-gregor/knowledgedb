Git Fresh
April 7, 2024

   I don't know if this is a personal quirk or a side effect of my role (designer first, developer
   second), but my Git branchs rarely stray far from main. I branch; I whip up whatever prototype,
   pattern or design adjustment I had in mind; I return to and update main; I branch again.

   So I find myself running these three commands over and over:
$> git checkout main
$> git pull
$> git checkout -b my-fresh-branch

   After an especially productive and branch-filled afternoon, I wondered if I could simplify that and
   save myself some typing.

First Attempt with Switch
   Since two of the commands use checkout, my first instinct was to try combining them. This led me to
   switch, a checkout alternative that supports an optional starting point.

   Here's how I'd create a new branch from main without checking it out first:
$> git switch main -c my-fresh-branch

   Ah, but there's a problem: We're still branching off the local main, which might be out of date. We
   can solve that by specifying the remote as the starting point:
$> git switch origin/main -c my-fresh-branch

   This works! But there's a quirk: Because I'm branching from the remote main, my local main remains
   as-is. Since I'll need to checkout and pull the latest main eventually, I've really only delayed that
   step.

   I think I can update my local main first without switching branches using fetch instead of pull:
$> git fetch origin main:main
$> git switch main -c my-fresh-branch

   But now I'm typing more characters than ever! Plus, that fetch command errors out if you accidentally
   run it while already on main. This felt like a wrong turn.

Success with Alias
   Having decided that the experience of my original three commands was fine, I thought I'd shift my
   focus to the repetition itself. This led me to Git Aliases, a method of defining little shortcut
   commands for git.

   I created an alias called fresh in my global config for my original three steps:
$> git config --global alias.fresh '!git checkout main && git pull && git checkout -b'

   And voilÃ ! Now I can run this instead:
$> git fresh my-fresh-branch

   You could do the same thing in fewer characters with an alias in your shell of choice (Zsh, Bash,
   etc.), but I struggle to commit my wholly custom aliases to memory. For whatever reason, typing git
   first unlocks that fold in my brain.
