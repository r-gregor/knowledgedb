 Cygwin on portable storage devices

Ali Devin Sezer
Feb 5, 2005

Cygwin is a software package that enables one to work in a UNIX-like
environment under a Windows machine. It is fast, reliable and easy to
install. It has most of the applications one uses on UNIX (gcc, X, xfig,
latex, Perl, bash, ps tools, textutils,...) and most of it is covered by
the GNU public license. Cygwin supports many flavors of Windows:XP, 2000,
98, etc. For more info on cygwin go toCygwin.com.

The goal of this page is to describe a way of installing cygwin on a portable
storage device like a portable hard drive or a USB memory stick. The main use
of such a setup, obviously, is that it enables you to carry a UNIX like system
in your pocket everywhere you go and use any Windows machine (e.g. Windows
pc's at your university library) with your own powerful cygwin/UNIX tools.
Choice of Portable device
The choice of device doesn't really change the installation process. However
here are some notes on this issue:

    USB memory stick: A core cygwin installation doesn't need more than a
    couple of hundred MBs. Thus a 1 GB USB memory stick easily gives you
    the capacity you need to install cygwin. But, remember that USB memory
    sticks are slow (bearable with NTFS crawling with FAT32) if you install
    a big file system  on them.

    CDROM's. Because CDROMs are read-only, they are a poor choice of media
    to install cygwin. See the following posts at cygwin.com:
        http://www.cygwin.com/ml/cygwin/2003-07/msg00026.html
        http://www.cygwin.com/ml/cygwin/2003-05/msg00692.html
        http://www.cygwin.com/ml/cygwin/2003-05/msg00705.html
        http://www.cygwin.com/ml/cygwin/2003-05/msg00728.html

    Portable Hard drives : Portable Hard drives are great. If you are getting
    one, make sure you get one that receives power through the USB cable
    and from the computer.

The rest of this note is independent of the choice of portable storage device.
Choice of Filesystem
You have two realistic choices for a file system (FS) on your portable storage
device:fat32 and ntfs. (For those who are not familiar with FSs: FS is what
is installed on a storage device when you format it. The formatting software
asks you which kind of FS you want). Although NTFS is a much better FS,
I had read/write permission problems with it when using different computers
on which i had different accounts. A simplistic solution to this problem is
to use fat32. That's what I do.
Installation
I assume that your portable storage device is already formatted. Here are
the steps:

    Go to cygwin.com and install cygwin on your portable storage device.
    Let's designate your portable storage device with "E:\" and assume that
    you installed cygwin in "E:\cygwin".

    As is, this installation will work only when your portable storage device
    is connected to the computer on which you performed the installation. What
    follows is  what you need to do so that your cygwin can work with any
    host windows computer.
    Unless it is not there, create the directory "E:\cygwin\home". Then
    create the directory "E:\cygwin\home\username", where username is a user
    name that you pick. (e.g. your name). This will be your home directory:
    whenever you start an rxvt or an xterm it will start with this directory
    as the current directory.

    Copy profile to E:\cygwin\etc. Open it with an editor (e.g. notepad)
    and replace the phrase "username" (it occurs twice) with the user name
    you have chosen above.

    Download X.tab and put it in "E:\". Rename it "X.bat" [*]. This script
    assumes that you installed cygwin under "E:\cygwin" on your storage
    device. If you installed it in some other directory you will need to
    modify this script to reflect that ( X.bat figures out the drive label of
    the portable device [assumed to be E in this discussion] on its own. So
    you have to change X.bat only if cygwin is installed in some directory
    other than "cygwin" in the root directory of your portable storage
    device). X.bat inserts several keys into the windows registry. This
    is required for cygwin to work. It also saves any key values that it
    might alter. Finally it starts a copy of the X server and a terminal
    (assuming that  X and rxvt were installed in step 1).[**]

    Download uninstall.tab and put it in "E:\". Rename it to "uninstall.bat"
    [*]. Run this script once you are done using cygwin and quit all cygwin
    software. It restores any registry keys that might have been altered
    when running "X.bat".

This is it. double clicking "X.bat" will make cygwin operational and start an
X server as well as an rxvt. When you exit all cygwin software, double click
"uninstall.bat".

If you are using a very old windows, replace

 for /f %%A in ('cd') do set WD=%%A

in "X.bat" with

set WD=%1

and start "X.bat" from "Run" in the Start menu by typing "X.bat [DRIVE]:\"
in the Run box, where [DRIVE] is the letter that Windows assigned to your
portable storage device (`E' in the above examples).

[*] This script is based on a script by Fergus in the CD-ROM related postings
at cygwin.com (see the links above).

[**]The scripts ``X.bat'' and ``uninstall.bat'' modify host's registry. They
insert several keys in the CURRENT USER and LOCAL MACHINE sections of the
registry. These keys are modified through the ``mount'' command of cygwin
and are  referred to by cygwin to find out which directories on the Windows
directory structure are going to be mapped to /bin, /lib and /. If cygwin
is already installed on the host, "X.bat" will save these entries before
changing them. The modified entries are later restored when you are done
using your portable cygwin and run the "uninstall.bat" script.

Pre-requisites
Before you install Cygwin Portable on your usb flash drive, you must first
install the PortableApps launcher. You can get the latest version at :
http://portableapps.com/download.

Warning : We have experienced performance issues while using usb flash drives
formatted with either FAT16 or FAT32. We strongly recommend that you use
NTFS formatted devices with PortableApps.

Normally, installing cygwin on a PC means that you'll need administrative
privileges on the system. This is needed because the cygwin startup needs
several mount points to be set, which are stored in the Windows registry.
However, it is possible to install cygwin on a USB stick, and run it on
any host PC without the need for admin privileges and/or registry hacks. The
following batch script will figure out the correct drive letter for the stick,
create the mount points, and start cygwin, and has been tested in Windows
2000 and XP; you only need to have write access to c:\temp on the host machine.

@echo off
for /F "delims=\: usebackq" %%i in (`cd`) do SET USB_DRIVE=%%i
echo USB driveletter is %USB_DRIVE%
REM pause
SET CYGWIN=tty title
SET PATH=%USB_DRIVE%:\cygwin\bin;%PATH%
echo PATH has been set to %PATH%
echo.
@echo on
mount -f -u -b %USB_DRIVE%:/cygwin /
mount -f -u -b %USB_DRIVE%:/cygwin/bin /usr/bin
mount -f -u -b %USB_DRIVE%:/cygwin/lib /usr/lib
@echo off
echo User mount points have been created.
echo.
echo @ECHO OFF > c:\temp\usbcygwin.bat
echo %USB_DRIVE%: >> c:\temp\usbcygwin.bat
echo CHDIR \cygwin\bin >> c:\temp\usbcygwin.bat
echo bash --login -i >> c:\temp\usbcygwin.bat
echo created c:\temp\usbcygwin.bat, starting cygwin.
echo.
c:\temp\usbcygwin.bat

Very good post. Thanks.
One question. If i already have an installation
of cygwin in my local drive it will corrupt the settings?

I'm not sure which setting you mean; I have done exactly what you want to
try and have not noticed any adverse affects.
However, cygwin will pick up your $HOME from your home directory in Windows
and will pick up stuff like .profile, .bashrc etc from there. So those
settings will be shared if you run cygwin from a USB drive.

Dunno... the following is simpler and seems to do the same.

@echo off
for /F "usebackq" %%i in (`cd`) do SET CYGROOT=%%i
SET PATH=%CYGROOT%\bin;%PATH%
mount -f -u -b %CYGROOT% /
mount -f -u -b %CYGROOT%/bin /usr/bin
mount -f -u -b %CYGROOT%/lib /usr/lib
for /F "delims=\:" %%i in ("%CYGROOT%") do SET CYGDRV=%%i
%CYGDRV%:
bash --login -i

Sloppy, sloppy me... the batch file above leaves some registry entries behind;
if Cygwin is installed on the machine and run from USB, the installed version
might break.

The fix is simple, though: just add

umount -U

at the end of the script. Enjoy!

Hi,

"you only need to have write access to c:\temp on the host machine."

It is not necessary.
Simply put, instead of C:\temp , the directory path that contains the
installation of cygwin on the USB key, like this %USB_DRIVE%:\cygwin

In this case you don't need to have write access to C:
