[18]Installing Cygwin on Windows XP without having the admin rights?

   Is it possible to install Cygwin on a Windows XP system without having the admin rights?

4 Answers

   To install Cygwin on Windows 7 without administrator rights, you first have to rename the
   setup program of Cygwin (setup.exe) to something else (e.g. cygwin.exe).

   If the Cygwin setup is named setup.exe, Windows 7 (or Cygwin?) seems to assume that it
   needs administrator rights to run.


   what a stupid win behaviour using "update" or "setup" keywords ;/ Thanks for the hint!
   Still works in Vista –  [33]childno.de Jun 6 '13 at 8:27

   I confirm this works from Windows 7 also. I am using a corporate machine without local
   admin rights. –  [34]kevinarpe Jun 19 '13 at 6:06

   I think so.

   Not being awkward, but, it is simple to try and it will have no negative consequences if
   you can't.

   If for some reason you can't, take a look at this earlier answer - [35]Gnu Tools for
   Windows

   You will be able to use some of the features of cygwin without doing an install.

   it is not that easy... I'm behind a company firewall that blocks access to .exe files etc.
   So before downloading it, putting it on a USB key, sneaking it in here, etc. I'd like to
   know if it can be done or not :) –  [39]Gugussee Jan 5 '11 at 17:26

   Don't. I find it annoying to not have my shell tools on my work PC, but I also find it
   lacking in integrity to install software I'm not authorized for on a computer I don't own.
   –  [40]CarlF Jan 5 '11 at 17:41

   @Gugussee - If it's not your machine, and you're not allowed to, don't. It's just that
   simple. I guess if you really don't care about your job... –  [41]Shinrai Jan 5 '11 at

   It is possible. When I installed as non-Admin on my XP machines, the installer would ask if
   i wanted just for me (I did) or for all (where it needed an admin passwd). It can go
   anywhere on disk (though I'd recommend a folder without spaces in it, since many scripts
   don't guard against spaces in filepaths) and doesn't have much in the way of registry
   entries in base install. Some tools like inetd, sshd, and cron will need admin to install
   the services, but these are less critical.

   That said, I haven't tested on Win7 (I now have a Linux desktop, don't need Cygwin).

   As someone else said, be careful if you're not authorized for this. There are a lot of
   tools in corporate environments that look for rogue installs of software. You'll be
   installing a huge heap of EXEs for them to find.


   I have just done it, and it works like a charm. No problems so far with basic tools and X.

   The only noticeable problem so far is that the installer complains that it cannot write to
   the "All Users" start menu, even if I uncheck the option "Make start menu entries" and
   select "Install only for me".

Install and maintain Cygwin without Windows admin rights

   January 10, 2014 [50]odoepner [51]Leave a comment [52]Go to comments

   Sometimes you work on Windows as a restricted user, without admin rights. Like many other
   good software packages, [53]Cygwin can be installed anyway.

   These are the steps I used:
    1. Download [54]setup-x86.exe (32bit) or [55]setup-x86_64.exe (64bit).
    2. Run it with the “–no-admin” option
    3. During installation select the “wget” package
    4. Create /usr/local/bin/cygwin-setup.sh (for 32bit omit the “_64″):
#! /bin/sh
rm setup-x86_64.exe
wget http://cygwin.com/setup-x86_64.exe
chmod u+x setup-x86_64.exe
./setup-x86_64.exe --no-admin

    5. Make the script executable:
chmod ugo+x /usr/local/bin/cygwin-setup.sh
    6. Create a copy of the Cygwin terminal shortcut, rename it “Cygwin setup”
    7. Edit the shortcut target, replace
mintty.exe -i /Cygwin-Terminal.ico -
       with
mintty.exe -i /Cygwin-Terminal.ico /bin/bash -l -c 'cygwin-setup.sh'

   Whenever you want to run the Cygwin installer to install or remove packages, you can just
   execute the shortcut or run cygwin-setup.sh from the Cygwin command prompt.

   Alternatively, you could also use the pure command-line tool [56]apt-cyg.

[19]Manual Cygwin Installation without using Setup.exe

   I am having issues with finding all of the necessary files to actually install Cygwin
   correctly when not using the premade setup utility. The reason behind this is the fact that
   my company computer blocks the usage of the .exe, and won't give me clearance to install
   it, (they say it isn't needed for the job) but expects me to perform certain tasks that
   Cygwin would make much simpler.

   So my question is thus; is there somewhere/someone that would have a list of packages that
   I would need to manually install from one of the mirrors to make Cygwin run correctly?

   If you don't need the full POSIX compatibility (which I'm guessing you don't, if the Unix
   subsystem isn't required for your job), I'd generally suggest you go with [34]Mingw rather
   than Cygwin.

   Sadly, Mingw also has an installer these days. It probably also requires admin (try it and
   see). However, you can download the individual components you need if you want to do it
   that way. That shouldn't require admin, so it would probably get you exactly what you want.

   Mingw is also more corporate-friendly from a licensing standpoint, as its compiler doesn't
   render code built with it GPL like Cygwin's does.

   Generally the rule is:
     * If you want to use Unixy tools to help with your native Windows development, you want
       Mingw.
     * If want to port a full (POSIX) Unix program to windows, you want Cygwin (and perhaps a
       support deal with Red Hat to get around the licensing problem).


   It's an ugly world we live in where an Assistant Sys. Admin can't use any .exe's to install
   jack and or sh**. Working on going for a core download on MinGW, seems like an extremely
   viable route, stay tuned! –  [39]Jeff Langemeier Jun 30 '11 at 17:52

   @Jeff Langemeier - Understand completely. Our IT folks recently took away our access to
   SourceForge. Keeping our developers from that site is pretty much insane, considering we
   actually deliver some downloads from there (Mingw stuff, boost, etc.) to our own customers.
   We can no longer get (or even check for) updates. –  [40]T.E.D. Jun 30 '11 at 18:06

   Well, now I at least have some development capabilities, I'll have to remember to grab
   MinGW in the future, much simpler to handle commandline installation than Cygwin was being.
   –  [41]Jeff Langemeier Jun 30 '11 at 18:19


   Well,

   This is a new answer to an old question, but it might be helpful for someone...

   Just run the installer with -B switch, for example:
setup-x86_64.exe -B

   You should install it then on a path where you have rights.


   You are awesome. Thanks –  [45]AsemRadhwi Nov 24 '13 at 5:13

   Thaks @AsemRadhwi, the cool thing is that the info is right on the cygwin website:
   [46]cygwin.com/faq/faq.html#faq.setup.cli And it worked fine, but as mentioned in the post,
   you need to have rights on the install path... –  [47]Martin Nov 25 '13 at 12:51

   Thanks, Martin! Helps a lot! –  [48]LynxLee Dec 17 '13 at 7:09

   There's a writeup on [49]getting Cygwin [to work] on portable storage devices.

   Boiling it down, you'd have to do this on a machine that does give you .exe/admin access to
   write to a 'stick, then run from the stick at work.

   On the off-chance that super-lockdown-site allows you to run USB devices.


   You could try installing it on another machine outside of work. After installing, copy the
   installed product's tree and Registry keys and environment settings to a CD or flash drive.
   Then you would have a DIY installation that you can copy and import settings manually. The
   installer doesn't do a whole lot else.

   Don't count on job security if you're bypassing IT mandates after being explicitly told no,
   though. Getting an exception to the rule by submitting proper documentation through the
   proper process is usually the way to go.

   You'll also have to hope that they aren't blocking the Cygwin programs and any Registry
   edits as well. It's not hard to find this sort of thing on a machine, either.


   Stupid draconian rules or no, I would not recommend trying to thwart your employers rules.
   Try working to improve the situation or find another one.

   But technically speaking if you can get a complete Cygwin install somewhere, you can copy
   the entire cygwin folder enmasse. There are a few things that you will want to change
   similarly to how I configured my cygwin installation to run from a thumb drive. I actually
   installed on my HD, copied it to the thumbdrive and then changed the batch file and a few
   other things to make it work. Here are the details:
   [56]http://fadedbluesky.com/2011/portable-cygwin/


   Use the GNUWIN32 utilities instead. [60]http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/

   That way you can choose only the .exe installs that you need, and it will be much easier to
   justify specific utilities than a humongous system install. If you hunt around on the site
   you can find the files directory where you can download a single utility, and if you get
   the -bin.zip version, then you can extract just the needed .exe file which would be even
   easier to justify and would not require your IT people to test an untrusted install
   package.

[19]Cygwin in Windows 7


   I am a fan of linux but due to worst intel wireless drivers in linux, I had to switch to

   I googled and found this webpage,
   [21]http://art.csoft.net/2009/09/02/cygwin-ssh-server-and-windows-7/ I am getting the

   The permissions of this folder are shown as Read-only(Only applies to this folder) checked
   in gray. I tried to uncheck, but after I open the properties again, the box is again
   checked. Is there a way to change the permissions of this folder.

   Thank you

   is it related to window UAC? will it happen if you run Cygwin using Administrator? –

   Just in case anyone else comes across this old, old cygwin + sshd question looking for
   troubleshooting tips: you should probably look elsewhere. Answering "no" to "Query: Should
   privilege separation be used? (yes/no) no" (and "yes" to running sshd as a service) means
   that any attempt to make this work is probably in vain. First: I don't know why you
   wouldn't use privilege separation; second, if you don't, I'm guessing this option is not
   going to be very well tested/supported/documented across different versions/configurations
   of Windows. –  [34]michael_n Oct 1 '12 at 3:25

   I'm running cygwin 1.7 on Windows 7 x64 and sshd. I don't remember getting this error when
   I ran sshd_config, but I just looked at my /var/run directory and it's set to 777.

   Try this in a cygwin shell chmod 777 /var/run


   +1. Change the permissions within Cygwin and try again. –  [41]Arkaaito Jan 29 '10 at 3:41

   Sorry to unbury such an old thread, but this question always came up when I googled this
   specific problem.

   After a few months, I finally found a solution. When I set up cygwin, I didn't have my user
   and group accounts correctly created in cygwin. The main way to do this is to run:
mkpasswd -l > /etc/passwd
mkgroup -l > /etc/group

   If you are logging in using a domain user and passwd, you can do:
mkpasswd -l -d > /etc/passwd
mkgroup -l -d > /etc/group

   Or, if you have an incredibly large network like mine, you may not really want that. An
   alternative is to just user your local users and group plus whatever one you are currently
   logged in as:
mkpasswd -l > /etc/passwd
mkpasswd -c >> /etc/passwd
mkgroup -l > /etc/group
mkgroup -c >> /etc/group

   After I did this, I was finally able to run ssh-host-config correctly to create the
   service.

   In a cygwin shell, make sure you are administrator then:
takeown /F "C:\cygwin" /R
icacls "C:\cygwin" /grant Everyone:\(F\) /T
icacls "C:\cygwin"
chmod 777 -R "c:\cygwin"


   This, too, is a no-op for me. I think the answer to why this doesn't work for some of us
   must lie in the Windows permissions for /var/run. Nothing I've done, however, has had any
   effect. I've removed all permissions on /var/run and made one ones that are wide open.
