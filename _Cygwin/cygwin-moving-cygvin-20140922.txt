   ... also relevant for backing up Cygwin.

   Here are the steps to move your Cygwin installation:
    1. Save off existing mount points
       mount -m > /usr/bin/mountCommands.bat
    2. Unmount existing mount points
       umount -A
    3. Copy Cygwin directory to new home -- or mv it.  Use Cygwin commands, not Windows Explorer
       commands or you'll get broken symlinks and distorted permissions in some circumstances.
         1. mount -s -b --change-cygdrive-prefix "/cygdrive"
         2. tar -cvf /cygdrive/c/cygwin.tar bin cygwin dev etc lib sbin srv tmp usr var cygwin.bat
            cygwin.ico
         3. cd $destination
         4. mkdir cygdrive
         5. tar -xvpf /cygdrive/c/cygwin.tar
    4. In theory, you could do the previous steps with something like: cd /; tar -cf - * | (cd "$tgt";
       tar -xfp - )
    5. Update any Windows shortcuts & Start Menu items
    6. Update the Cgywin path within $CYGWIN_HOME/cygwin.bat
    7. Update mount points within $CYGWIN_HOME/bin/mountCommands.bat
    8. Re-mount to new location
          + Start Cygwin
          + ./mountCommands.bat
          + Close Cygwin

   Note: If you move cygwin to a flash drive, and you intend to use the flash drive on multiple
   computers (or even in multiple instances of Windows on the same computer), you'll need to format the
   flash as FAT32.  If you use NTFS, the file owner will be static by GUID, and it won't work except on
   one computer.


   Moving your home directory:
    1. Use Cygwin commands, not Windows Explorer commands or you'll get broken symlinks and distorted
       permissions in some circumstances.
    2. I use a symlink '/home' to point to the directory that contains user home directories, so that
       has to get updated
    3. You might need to update the Windows HOME environment variable, because cygwin uses it to set
       your cygwin home directory.
    4. I started getting double-wide display with rxvt.  It was because my Windows HOME environment
       variable was set to newdrive\home instead of newdrive\home\kevin

   Note: You *do* want your home directory to be NTFS, so that .ssh can have the correct permissions.

   -------------
   $ umount -A
   umount: unknown option -- A
   Try `umount --help' for more information.
   =============================
   $ mount -s -b --change-cygdrive-prefix "/cygdrive"
   mount: unknown option -- s
   Try `mount --help' for more information.
   ===========================
