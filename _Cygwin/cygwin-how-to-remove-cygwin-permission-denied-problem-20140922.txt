How to remove Cygwin completely from Windows

   9th September 2012. 22165 views. [6]Software

   Remember needing Cygwin back in the day, but after using it to my only occasion forgot the
   software-libraries completely? That happened to me. I have installed Windows 7 again, and found my
   C:\cygwin folder with all the files. Wanted to get rid of it, but no way - a mysterious "permission
   denied" when deleting the files. It seems there's no way to remove it. Cygwin protects the files with
   some security stuff. That's just idiotic, having no access to my own files!

   I'm always logged in as native Administrator - no other users present. What I tried next was to
   navigate to that folder through my Linux machine (cifs mounted filesystem), but got "permission
   denied" error there as well, even with the magic command:
sudo rm -rf /media/windows/cygwin

   [INS: :INS]

   Here's how to remove Cygwin once and for all.

   You will need
     * Cygwin
     * cmd.exe
     * 2 minutes

   Run cmd, navigate to C:\ (or other disk, if you have installed it in different path).

   This command takes ownership recursive of the folder, without asking anything:
takeown /r /d y /f cygwin

   This command gives Full Access to Everyone recursively in the folder:
icacls cygwin /t /grant Everyone:F

   And finally, the command which deletes it all and removes Cygwin:
rmdir /s /q cygwin

   Good bye Cygwin!

       Thank you. Can you tell me how to come up with this solution?

            I usually find every solution by experimenting, this was no different. :-) I trust in the
            power of command line!

                 I do the same. Unlikely so, your method did not work for me because Cygwin was no
                 longer working on my PC (my PC has crashed several times after I left it), So instead
                 of all those 3rd Party apps, I experimented.
                 What I did was, I used the inbuilt system of Windows (properties). Then the Security
                 tab, and I found that I could not change the permissions for now. Then I went to
                 Advanced, then to Owner tab, to find that the ownership was set to my previous account
                 (one that I used before my system crashed). I clicked on my current account and clicked
                 apply.
                 Then I went to Permissions tab, and then I found that I could grant myself Full Control
                 over the folder. Yay!
                 Then I deleted it, once and for all.
                 I feel you should also add this method to the list, for the needy. Even though the post
                 is about an year old.

       Hi:
       I tried it but the bin and etc directories remain. I can't even open the etc directory.

       Hi, I got rid of them once I killed the bash process that was running. Thanks for the great
       information. Much appreciated.

       Hi, we had trouble with "takeown" and Administrator rights, so we fund this workaround:
       - connect with an account which is Administrator (no need of Super Administrator): for example,
       my-windows-account
       - open cmd with the option "execute as admin"
       - execute: takeown /A /r /d y /f cygwin (/A gives ownership to admin group)
       - execute: icacls cygwin /t /grant:r my-windows-account:F (:r to force/impose new ownership)
       - execute: rmdir /s /q cygwin
       Thx Roni for your post.

       I haven't run the takeown command but did run the last two commands. Is it still hiding inside my
       registry (win7)?

       didn't work for me, but found another way:
       takeown /F "path of the folder where cygwin is" then hit ENTER. it gives a full access to that
       specific folder
       then go to that folder right click and DELETE it,

       thank you! your solution worked great for me!
       2 things though, for others who try it - it takes more than 2 minutes, so if you run the command
       and it seems not to stop - just wait...also you should open the cmd as administrator

       Frankly, your method did not work for me. Mainly because Cygwin was no longer working. I had
       installed it long ago, with a different account on my XP. But then my System crashed, and I had
       to recover my OS. But now the account did not exist anymore, neither the Cygwin.bat worked (tried
       running it through cmd too, but no success).
       I thought of trying Unlocked and Long Path Tool. None worked, as Unlocker hanged and stopped
       responding, whereas LPT asked for a Key (I don't like spending money on stupid things).
       So I used my own brain. i am not even sure of what I did, I just kept trying till I succeeded.
       1- I right-clicked it and opened up the Properties. I clicked the Security tab, to find that I
       could not change the permissions here (I could not grant myself full control).
       2- Clicked "Advanced" and then in the "Owner" tab, I clicked my own account and then checked some
       box "Replace owner...". Clicked Apply. I could not grant full control still.
       3- Went to Permissions tab. Clicked on my account name, and then ticked both boxes below, and
       then clicked Apply.
       Finally, I granted all accounts full access from the Security tab. Then I deleted the folder.
       That folder was taking 4 GB of space from my HDD! Phew!
       So guys, just remember to use your own brain and not to depend on 3rd party softwares. Windows
       has its own features, and most of the time you won't require all those things.

            Yeah, this tutorial is for those who had it on the same machine. Cygwin acts by default
            leaving files behind... you did practically more advanced version of my technique but using
            UI instead of cmd. :) thanks for the advice!

       hey bro, you officially are HISTORY
       I mean it, probably the guys who invented cygwin are goddam pissed right now LOOOL
       no seriously I think that's cool cos there seems to be no other way to install node.js (something
       I need badly) without using cygwin

       the process in the article worked for me too; excellent, thank you. The first time I tried it, I
       accidentally overlooked the iacacls step and it didn't work until I went back and did it as
       instructed
