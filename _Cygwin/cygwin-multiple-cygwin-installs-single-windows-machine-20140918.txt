Well,
I thought this would be helpful

Just move or rename cygwin folder to what location. [ex: C or D:\CygwinPSP]

Then Modify cygwin.bat to this:

Example:
Code:
@echo off

D:
chdir D:\cygwinPSP\bin

umount -s --remove-all-mounts
mount -s -b -f d:\cygwinPSP\bin /bin
mount -s -b -f d:\cygwinPSP\etc /etc
mount -s -b -f d:\cygwinPSP\lib /lib
mount -s -b -f d:\cygwinPSP\usr /usr
mount -s -b -f d:\cygwinPSP\var /var
mount -s -b -f d:\cygwinPSP\home /home
mount -s -b -f d:\ /
mount -s -b -f d:\cygwinPSP\bin /usr/bin
mount -s -b -f d:\cygwinPSP\lib /usr/lib
mount -c -s /cygdrive
mount -c -u /cygdrive

set PSPDEV=/usr/local/pspdev
set PSPSDK=/usr/local/pspdev
set path=/usr/local/pspdev/bin;%path%

bash --login -i

pause
For each installation modify batch file to point to new location

Especially useful when you work on other platforms not just for PSP , to prevent any conflicts or just to stay
on safe side.

Remind me why exactly you might need multiple cygwin installs.
It's useful when u want to have multiple toolchains of different platforms setup [XDK, ARM, etc] 

You ofcourse dont need PSP* variables in batch file. :)

---
You can install multiple toolchains on the same Cygwin install but have separate .bats to start it up if need
be. I used to have the same cygwin install for PC, GP2X and PSP.
