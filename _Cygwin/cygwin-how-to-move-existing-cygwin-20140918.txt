How to move an existing Cygwin installation

   Although [16]Cygwin is a self-contained installation with little in the way of the normal tendrils
   hooked into the dark shady corners of Windows there are a few hidden catches to moving an existing
   installation.
   Cygwin creates a number of mount points for your drives, and it's these that cause the problems when
   you move your installation directory around.
   Here are the steps to move your Cygwin installation:
    1. Save off existing mount points
       mount -m > /usr/bin/mountCommands.bat
    2. Unmount existing mount points
       umount -A
    3. Copy Cygwin directory to new home
    4. Update any Windows shortcuts & Start Menu items
    5. Update the Cgywin path within $CYGWIN_HOME/cygwin.bat
    6. Update mount points within $CYGWIN_HOME/bin/mountCommands.bat
    7. Re-mount to new location
          + Start Cygwin
          + ./mountCommands.bat
          + Close Cygwin
    8. Restart Cygwin, and carry on with life

          For windows you probably want to do a scan on your registry also to catch the file explorer
          context menu and installer path.

          Thanks Andy! This really did help me out. My Cygwin install size was 4.4 Gigs & it took me 25
          minutes just to copy it from 1 drive to the other. Uninstall & install would have taken 3
          hours at least. Appreciate your help.
