Using “email” command in Cygwin [closed]
up vote 1 down vote favorite
1

I am trying to use Cygwin to send an e-mail from the command line. This 
is what I am putting in: 


email -f myaddress@blah.com -s "This is a test" -b toaddress@blah.com

I get this error message:

/bin/sh: /usr/lib/sendmail: No such file or directory

I created a folder in /usr/lib called "sendmail", and now I get this:

/bin/sh: /usr/lib/sendmail: is a directory

Can someone please give me a step-by-step on how to send an email from 
Cygwin? Like how to set it up and everything? I have looked everywhere 
and I am about ready to tear my hair out. 


EDIT: Thanks for your responses guys. This is how I finally got it to work.

bash.exe -c "echo  -e 'To: thepeopleimsendingitto@blah.com\nSubject: mySQL Upload\nSQL files from machines uploaded to log table successfully.' | sendmail -f me@blah.com otherpeople@blah.com"

Even though Cygwin was in my Windows path, it couldn't recognize it, so 
I had to run bash.exe directly and say "do this command as a Linux 
command". The echo is what is constructing the email itself. The \n 
characters separate it into "To", "Subject" and Body.

what type of email server are you trying to connect to? connecting to an 
exchange server is rather difficult from what i've seen. –

Yeah it's a Microsoft Exchange server. – snowfi6916 Dec 13 '12 at 15:30

Apparently, email is a program that lets you submit an email message (a 
Mail Submission Agent) that relies on a another program to actually send 
the message (a Mail Transfer Agent). 

I enabled this ability on my Cygwin installation last week. I am not 
using email but mutt, one of the alternatives Cygwin offers (see its 
package list). I use mutt not only to submit the mail to be sent, but 
also to read it; it's a Mail User Agent (see some screenshots). 

Like email, mutt relies on a Mail Transfer Agent to send mail, so I had 
to install one. On Linux, popular choices are sendmail and postfix; but 
they do far more than you need and Cygwin doesn't offer them as 
packages. It does offer exim and ssmtp. I installed the ssmtp package 
and ran the ssmtp-config utility. You have to make some decisions here. 
You must know which SMTP server you can use and whether you need any 
special configuration to communicate with it. I found this unix.org 
forum thread helpful. 

By the way, ssmtp does install an executable called sendmail, which is 
not the original sendmail, but behaves like it for the purposes you need 
it for.

Okay So i wasn't clear enough on my first attempt... I guess that is my 
fault, I will try to make this more clear. 

In the mail-config it will ask for the sendmail binary. It should sound 
something like this : 


Please enter the sendmail command line [/usr/sbin/sendmail -t -i]:

This is basically asking where is the sendmail binary installed and what 
parameters should i pass it to send a mail. Your sendmail binary is 
either not installed, or not installed in the location you are 
specifying. 

To see if you have sendmail installed try

%sendmail;

If that works, to find the path of that binary try

%which sendmail; 

If that does not work, either sendmail is not installed, or the location 
of sendmail needs to be appended to the env path variable. There no 
correct answer on how you want to set things up, but the minimum 
requirments to make this work is to have sendmail on the current 
machine, have it configured and pass the correct absolute path to the 
mail program in the mail-config.

sending email from shell scripts on cygwin

I'm running shell scripts on cygwin and would like to send an email to an 
external account based on the results of the shell script. From reading the 
documentation, I think I need to use mutt and exim and I've installed those. I 
also think I need to run config commands (exim-config and ssmtp-config) and edit 
config files (/etc/ssmtp/ssmtp.conf and /etc/exim.conf).

I have tried to make sense of all the documentation I can find on the subject 
on-line and tried a ton of various combinations but no matter what I try I get 
very unhelpful (to me) errors of various flavors like:

> ssmtp: Cannot open :25
> Error sending message, child exited 1 ().
> Could not send the message.

or

> ssmtp: Cannot open mail.company.net:110
> Error sending message, child exited 1 ().
> Could not send the message.

I admit I get stuck on responding to config script questions like "what is the 
FQDN of your computer?". My response is usually "How the *#*$$ should I know?".

What I do know is:

The login I use under Cygwin = "mylogin"
The SMTP server I use for Thunderbird email access = "mail.company.net" (not the 
real one - just a stand-in for this usenet posting)
The user name = "myusername" (so my external email address is of the form 
"myusername@mail.company.net")
The port I use on that server = 110
The server type = POP

Given that, can anyone point me in the right direction IN LAYMANS TERMS to 
running the config tools and/or editing the config files so I can just send a 
stinkin' email? Is there some other tool/config file I'm missing?

I'm running exim version 4.76 and mutt 1.5.20.

	Ed.

Sounds like a firewall issue.  Could be at your end, or at your ISP's 
end.  Some ISP's - e.g. mine - block certain ports for domestic 
connections to prevent people from running a server.  Port 110 is 
normally used as the port for retrieving mail, and port 25 for sending 
mail.

However, I see that you are posting this message from a Microsoft 
Windows machine.  Would this be the same machine as which has Cygwin on 
it?  If so, then port 110 is apparently open, because you wouldn't be 
able to send this message to Usenet otherwise, and in the same vein, I 
suspect that you'd also be able to retrieve e-mail on this box, 
signifying that port 25 is also open.

FQDN stands for "Fully Qualified Domain Name".  So that would be 
"company.net", or "mail.company.net".

I apologize for snipping most of your post, but I don't know
answers to the questions you asked and merely want to suggest
a workaround you might use until you get a real answer.

You mentioned Thunderbird email access, so I suppose you have
it installed and working.  The following describes how to send
email via Thunderbird command line options.

sending mail from a shell script either on Unix or Cygwin requires the 
mail "user agent" software (in this case mutt or exim) to connect to a 
mail "server" software running usually on an ISP.  The problem is that 
most ISPs frown on this because it allows zombified Windows boxes to 
send mail through their servers, thereby getting them in trouble with 
other ISPs and labeled a "black hat" ISP or source of SPAM.

So ISPs do a lot to limit what remote systems can do to send mail 
through them.  One thing they do is limit access to only those machines 
that belong to their customers.  That's why you can't connect through 
Port 25.  That's blocked pretty much by all ISPs these days at your 
internet modem.  Getting it unblocked most likely won't happen in your 
case, given your lack of knowledge and expertise.

They also do this by requiring an authenticated connection through a 
encrypted username and password.  mutt and exim are _local_ mail agents 
that are usually configured to transfer the message created to the local 
mail transfer agent, which will send it to a remote system.  I doubt you 
installed sendmail on your system and are trying to send mail to your 
ISP's mail transfer agent from mutt or exim.  

From what I read, mutt must be built to support POP access. exim can't 
access pop at all.

http://www.exim.org/lurker/message/20010630.162938.92428252.ca.html

http://lists.netisland.net/archives/plug/plug-2001-09/msg00111.html

If your version of pop doesn't allow you to connect in this way, you're 
going to have to build mutt with the proper support.  If that's outside 
your pay grade, it's time to read up and start learning how to do this 
sort of thing.

I'm not sure where port 110 comes into play, since you're saying you want
to SEND email (which is normally done using the SMTP protocol), while port
110 is usually used for the POP protocol (ie, RECEIVING email from a
mailbox).

Another strange thing is that the error messages you're pasting seem to
come from "ssmtp", which is a simple MTA (ie, like exim or postfix,
but much simpler and for different usage scenarios).

Email isn't the simplest of things, but let's try in the most layman terms
I can :-)

To send email from a script, you need to either speak SMTP yourself to
some MTA[*] in the script (which I think is out of the question given your
simple needs), ot you must have a local MTA to use, although it can be a
simple one.

Normally, if the LOCAL you have installed (exim, ssmtp, postfix, whatever)
is configured correctly (we'll come to that later), sending mail is quite
simple. Since each of those MTAs usually is symlinked to "sendmail" for
compatibility, one possibility is to use the sendmail interface directly
and do

{ echo "From: me@my.company"
  echo "To: someone@other.company"
  echo "Subject: Hello"
  echo ""
  echo "Blah, blah, blah."
} | sendmail -t

the -t switch tells the MTA to extract the informations it needs to deliver
the message from the message headers, so in this case it will use the From:
and To: address to deliver. (the above example is a bit simplified, and
some mailers will complain if you for example omit some headers like
"Date:" or don't follow the RFC strictly when writing the From: and TO:
addresses, etc.; but that should get you started). See for example
http://kangry.com/topics/viewcomment.php?index=427 for other examples.

Another (perhaps simpler) option is to use "mail", or "mailx", if it's
available. What it does is read the message (only the body, no headers) from
stdin, and do the heavy lifting of calling the local sendmail for you. So
you'd do for example:

echo "Blah, blah, blah." | mail -s "Hello" someone@other.company

and it will (try to) send it for you. Obviously, it has to pick some
sensible values for the headers that it needs to add (eg, the "From:"
header), but again, if the mailer that it calls ("sendmail", which in turn
can be exim, ssmtp, etc.) is configured correctly, it should work.


Now for the big question: is the local mailer configured correctly?
Well, first things first: do you have a local MTA installed? (most
systems don't).
To check, I'd look for installed packages called "exim" (or "exim4", or
anything with "exim" in its name), "postfix", "sendmail", "ssmtp",
"nullmailer" (these are some of the most popular ones).
If it's installed, we can just hope that it's configured correctly (I'm not
very familiar with cygwin, but in most linux distributions they come with a
correct - if a bit restrictive - out-of-the box configuration) and try to
send mail using sendmail -t as in the example above.
If it works, you're done (unless you want to go the mail|mailx way, but
that's just a matter of installing the package - or using it if it's
already installed).

If it doesn't work, I'm afraid you'll have to adjust the configuration
until it works, and that is MTA-dependent (and usually, at least for
the most complex ones, not really for the faint of heart, to be honest).

If an MTA is not installed in your system, OR you have one of the heavy
ones like exim or postfix but it doesn't appear to work and you don't
want to mess around, you can install a simple MTA like ssmtp or
nullmailer (removing the existing one if there is one). 

I suggest installing one of the simple ones because they can (easily) be
configured to just relay all mail to another MTA (ie, presumably your
company's, and likely the one you use in Thunderbird to send outgoing mail).

Since, from the errors you posted, you appear to have ssmtp, here's how to
configure it. Normally, you just need to change the "mailhub" line in the
config file, eg

mailhub=smtp.your.company

if *that* MTA allows mail relay from the machines inside the company
(likely), that should be it for you. Try to send mail and see. If that
still doesn't work, you can use ssmtp in sendmail mode with "sendmail -t
-v" to get the log of what it does when sending mail, and see where the
problem is. You may need to set up authentication for example, which you can
still do in ssmtp's configuration file (for example, using the same
credentials you use in Thunderbird). The man page will explain the
parameters you need.

Hope this helps.


[*] simplifiying, a mailer (also known as MTA) is just some program that
speaks the SMTP protocol, and can be told to (try to) deliver mail to some
recipient.
