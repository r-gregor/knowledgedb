How To Use Rclone To Mount Disks On Ubuntu Servers 2025

What is Rclone:
Rclone is a tool designed to manage and synchronize data across various cloud storage services and local
filesystems. The tool can be installed on your systems/servers and can be easily connected to multiple cloud
storages like Amazon S3, Google Drive, Mega, Open Drive, Dropbox and many more. You just need to setup for
your storage and get an extra directory right into your local listing with contents. It's amazing. The tool is
useful when comes to the streaming providers using Xtream UI, XUI.ONE or other panels, they don't need to have
files locally to be selected and used but these clouds can be used instead.

I'll be covering Linux (Ubuntu) version of Rclone and setup these services one by one along with my YouTube
videos.

Install Rclone On Ubuntu:
Login to your server SSH and open terminal. Run following command and latest Rclone is installed and ready to
go:
$> apt install zip unzip curl ; curl -O https://downloads.rclone.org/rclone-current-linux-amd64.zip ; \
	unzip rclone-current-linux-amd64.zip ; cd rclone-*-linux-amd64 ; sudo cp rclone /usr/bin/ ; \
	sudo chown root:root /usr/bin/rclone ; sudo chmod 755 /usr/bin/rclone ; rclone version

The output should be information about the version you just got installed. So, Rclone is now ready and we need
to move out to setting up cloud storages one by one.

Let's start with MEGA.NZ and then keep on going for the other storage providers as I keep making videos on
them.

Setup Rclone For MEGA.NZ On Ubuntu:
So, let's start the thing over SSH.

Run following command to open setup for Rclone:
$> rclone config

Now you need first reply with n stands for new setup:
a

Reply with name of the storage (later be used for identification, recommended to use storage company name like
Mega):
Mega

Now you'll see a list of providers and their services that Rclone is supporting, watch carefully and reply
with the relevant number of the provider.

In our case, It's 29 for Mega so, replying up with 29
29

It'll now ask for mega creditionals, reply with your Mega account email:
mega-email@email.com

Now It'll ask about password, reply him with 1 so, we'll add our own password which we use to login to our
Mega account:
1

Reply back again with the Mega account password:
********

Now It's asking, do you want to edit advance settings? for sure not so reply with 2 (i think, reply
accordingly):
2

So now It's asking for is it all ok, should we save this provider hit him Yes:
1

And finally need to out from the Rclone setup menu by replying back with q stands for quite:
q

We still have much more to do yet, ah yes actually. Run following command to counter fusermount errors:
$> sudo ln -s /bin/fusermount /bin/fusermount3

After this, we need to first create a folder on our server which will be used to mount for Mega storage.
Create one if you not have some already by:
$> mkdir -p /mega

So now our folder is created now we need to mount our mega directory to this folder as permanent. For that we
need to setup auto run command in crontab as follow:

Setup Autostart of service.
I made a script for you to get this thing done quickly over the terminal, run following command it will bring
up the list of menu's, chose add new service, write your cloud storage name you did set on rclone and choose
the directory against that over your server and script will do rest of your stuff. Once done, you should be
seeing the content on your server and everything is auto setup.

You can easily add more services, edit or delete them. Just remember, choose a fresh directory for rclone
otherwise it may harm your existing data in directory within your server.
$> wget lofertech.com/scripts/rclone.sh ; bash rclone.sh

Or manually get it done by following:
On terminal, create a file naming "rclone1.service" , you can use new name for each storage to run separately.
mega: is storage name you set on terminal and /mega is directory on your server, make sure to use them
correctly into the file and we used the user "root" update it if require.
$> sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/rclone1.service

Put following code into the file and save it.
[Unit]
Description=Rclone Mount Mega Drive
Wants=network-online.target
After=network-online.target

[Service]
Type=simple
ExecStart=/usr/bin/rclone mount mega: /mega \
    --copy-links \
    --no-gzip-encoding \
    --no-check-certificate \
    --allow-other \
    --allow-non-empty \
    --umask 000 \
    --vfs-cache-mode writes
ExecStop=/bin/fusermount -u /mega
Restart=on-abort
User=root
Group=root
Environment=PATH=/usr/bin
Environment=DISPLAY=:0
Environment=XAUTHORITY=/root/.Xauthority

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target

Now Type: CTRL + X + Y (or save the file somehow)

Reload the daemon by following command:
$> sudo systemctl daemon-reload

Enable it, use following:
$> sudo systemctl enable rclone1.service

Time to start, run following and see if you can see the content in directory:
$> sudo systemctl start rclone1.service

Following are commands in cause you need to restart or check status:
$> sudo systemctl start rclone1.service
$> sudo systemctl stop rclone1.service
$> sudo systemctl status rclone1.service

Following is the whole command in cause you need. mega: is storage name you did set on terminal and /mega is
the directory name on the server. Make sure you do match them. If you run this and stopped it and not getting
it back running, you need to kill the process ID or reboot the server instead.
$> rclone mount mega: /mega --copy-links --no-gzip-encoding --no-check-certificate --allow-other \
	--allow-non-empty --umask 000 --vfs-cache-mode writes

Check on terminal if the directory for your cloud storage has loaded correctly:
$> ls /mega

Now you should be getting list of available directories and files inside over your terminal. If not things not
gone well, try run following command and check directory on some FTP software like WinSCP.

Remember: While running the command, it will not return to a reply if all good otherwise it will show some
error.

Remember: While mounting to the targeted directory, make sure to use correct service name you setup on Rclone
and correct directory name on your local server.

For other storage mounts, you can try the starter steps to open up mount storage menu, select relevant
service, add required information, submit and follow other steps. I will be writing on more soon as plan to
make video on them. Until this is the one, make sure to watch my Videos and Subscribe to the channel.
