   How to generate a full vps backup using rclone How to generate a full vps backup using rclone This
   article provides a detailed step-by-step description of how to generate a full VPS backup using
   rclone.


  What is rclone?
   Rclone is a powerful open-source command-line tool for managing files on cloud storage services
   and local storage. You can think of it as kind of like "rsync" (the popular file-copying tool), but
   specifically designed to work with cloud providers.

   At its core, rclone can:
     * Upload, download, sync, and copy files between your local computer, servers, and over 90 cloud
       storage providers (like Google Drive, Dropbox, S3, OneDrive, Backblaze B2, etc.)
     * Mount cloud storage as a local filesystem
     * Encrypt files before uploading
     * Serve files over HTTP, WebDAV, FTP, or SFTP
     * Schedule backups, sync directories, and even do server-to-server migrations with no local
       download

   Some common use cases:
     * Backup your VPS to Google Drive automatically
     * Move large datasets between AWS S3 and Wasabi
     * Mount your Dropbox as a drive on your Linux server
     * Sync an encrypted folder to Backblaze B2
     * Copy a full remote Google Drive folder to a local NAS

   Quick example command:
$> rclone sync /local/folder remote:backup-folder

   Where remote could be, say, your Google Drive or Dropbox account (configured beforehand).

   Why people love it:
     * Lightweight and fast
     * Highly configurable
     * Supports crypt, compression, bandwidth throttling
     * Free and open source

How to Generate a Full VPS Backup Using rclone
   To generate a full VPS backup using rclone, follow the steps provided below:
    1. Install rclone on your VPS
       First, you need rclone installed.
$> curl https://rclone.org/install.sh | sudo bash

       Check it's installed:
$> rclone version

    2. Set Up Your Remote Storage
       You need to tell rclone where you want to send the backup (Google Drive, S3, Dropbox, etc.).
       Start config:
$> rclone config

       Follow the prompts:
          + New remote -->n
          + Name -->(something like gdrive_backup)
          + Storage type -->pick your cloud provider
          + Authentication -->follow the steps (may need browser auth)

       Check your remote:
$> rclone listremotes

       You should see something like:
gdrive_backup:

    3. Decide What to Back Up
       You can back up:
          + Your entire / (full filesystem), or
          + Just key directories: /etc, /home, /var/www, /opt, etc.
       Warning: Backing up the entire system including /proc, /sys, /dev and /tmp is a bad idea.
       Those are virtual or ephemeral filesystems.

       Better strategy:
       Create a backup folder that excludes risky stuff.
       Example exclude list:
/etc
/home
/var/www
/opt
/root
/usr/local

    4. Create a Backup Archive (Optional but Recommended)
       Why?
          + Compresses files = faster upload
          + Packs everything = easier to restore
       Use tar to create an archive:
$> sudo tar --exclude=/proc --exclude=/sys --exclude=/dev --exclude=/tmp --exclude=/mnt --exclude=/media \
--exclude=/run -czvf /root/fullbackup.tar.gz /

       Explained:
          + --exclude skips volatile directories
          + -czvf = compress, zip, verbose, file
       You'll get /root/fullbackup.tar.gz.

    5. Upload Backup to Remote Storage
       Simple upload:
$> rclone copy /root/fullbackup.tar.gz gdrive_backup:/VPS-Backups/

       Or if you're backing up folders directly without tar:
$> rclone sync /etc gdrive_backup:/VPS-Backups/etc
$> rclone sync /home gdrive_backup:/VPS-Backups/home
$> rclone sync /var/www gdrive_backup:/VPS-Backups/www

    6. (Optional) Automate with a Cron Job
       You don't want to remember this every day. Set up a cronjob.
       Edit crontab:
$> crontab -e

       Add a line like:
0 3 * * * /usr/bin/tar --exclude=/proc --exclude=/sys --exclude=/dev --exclude=/tmp --exclude=/mnt \
--exclude=/media --exclude=/run -czf /root/fullbackup.tar.gz / && /usr/bin/rclone copy \
/root/fullbackup.tar.gz gdrive_backup:/VPS-Backups/

       Meaning: Every day at 3:00 AM, it will:
          + Create a fresh tar.gz
          + Upload it

    7. (Optional) Add Encryption
       To make it safer, encrypt backups.
       Use rclone's crypt backend:
       During rclone config, create a crypt remote that encrypts gdrive_backup:/VPS-Backups/ so data is
       encrypted at rest.
       Then upload to the encrypted remote instead.

Quick Summary
   Step  Action
   1     Install rclone
   2     Configure remote storage
   3     Choose what to backup
   4     (Optional) Create a tar archive
   5     Upload using rclone copy
   6     (Optional) Automate with cron
   7     (Optional) Encrypt backups

Alternate Guide: Generate a Full VPS Backup with rclone - 1 Step Guide

   folder), you can use our convenient 1-step process:
    1. Login via SSH as root, run the following commands:
$> wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Rad-Web-Hosting/vps-backup-rclone/refs/heads/main/vps_backup.sh
