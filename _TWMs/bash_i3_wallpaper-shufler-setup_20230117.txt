Howto Switch Wallpaper Periodically

...
You can use the tool feh, if you’re comfortable installing it in dom0.

Use cron to run a wallpaper script every ten minutes. Run crontab -e and add this to your crontab:

*/10 * * * * user /home/user/wallpaper.sh

Where wallpaper.sh might be something like:

#!/bin/bash

BG_DIR="/home/user/Pictures"
BG=$(ls /home/user/Pictures | shuf -n1)
feh --bg-scale "$BG_DIR/$BG"

This will give you randomization that’s as good as shuf, and won’t keep track of the previous wallpaper. But for a lot of images you shouldn’t get repeats very often.
