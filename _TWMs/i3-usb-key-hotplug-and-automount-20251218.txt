AI Overview:
USB devices are inherently designed to be hot-swappable (hotplug), meaning you can plug and unplug them
without turning off your computer. In the i3 window manager, this functionality is handled by background
system components like udev, which detect hardware events and can trigger scripts to automatically manage the
devices.  For a seamless user experience in i3, you typically need additional configuration or specific tools
to automatically mount the USB key and provide a user interface for managing it (mounting/unmounting).  How

Hotplugging Works in i3
Kernel & udev: When you plug in a USB key, the Linux kernel detects the new hardware, and udev (a device
manager) registers the event. udev rules can be configured to run specific scripts upon device connection.
Automatic Mounting: Unlike full desktop environments (like GNOME or KDE) which handle auto-mounting by
default, a default i3 installation requires manual setup or a helper application.  User Interaction: Tools are
often used to provide a convenient way to select and mount/unmount the device, often via a menu like rofi or
dmenu.

Common Tools and Approaches To get a desktop-environment-like hotplug experience in i3, popular methods
involve using udisks or udisks2 in combination with a user interface:

udisks/udisks2: These provide a D-Bus interface to access and manipulate storage devices. Many helper scripts
and front-ends rely on them.  udiskie: A popular, lightweight utility that automatically mounts removable
drives using udisks2 and can display notifications.  Custom Scripting: Advanced users often write custom
scripts using tools like udev and mount commands, which can then be triggered via keyboard shortcuts in i3 to
toggle the mounted state of a device.

By using these tools, you can ensure that when you plug in a USB key, it is detected and mounted correctly,
making the "hotplug" experience work smoothly within the minimalist i3 environment. Remember to safely unmount
the device before physically removing it to prevent data corruption.
