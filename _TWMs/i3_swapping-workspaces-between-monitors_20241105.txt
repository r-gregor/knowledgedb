User-contributed article: Swapping workspaces

   If you have workspace 1 on one monitor and workspace 2 on another monitor and want to quickly swap
   the workspaces among the monitors, you can use i3's IPC mechanisms to do it.

   i3 already includes a way to move an individual workspace from one monitor to another. But what we
   want to achieve is the simultaneous movement of workspaces between the monitors. To do this, we can
   write a script that detects the currently active workspace on each monitor and then moves that
   workspace to the other monitor.

#!/usr/bin/env bash
	# requires jq

	DISPLAY_CONFIG=($(i3-msg -t get_outputs | jq -r '.[]|"\(.name):\(.current_workspace)"'))

	for ROW in "${DISPLAY_CONFIG[@]}"
	do
		IFS=':'
		read -ra CONFIG <<< "${ROW}"
		if [ "${CONFIG[0]}" != "null" ] && [ "${CONFIG[1]}" != "null" ]; then
			echo "moving ${CONFIG[1]} right..."
			i3-msg -- workspace --no-auto-back-and-forth "${CONFIG[1]}"
			i3-msg -- move workspace to output right
		fi
	done

   To use this script, I recommend binding it to a keyboard shortcut in your i3 config:
bindsym $mod+Shift+s exec /path/to/your/script/i3-display-swap.sh

   Now restart i3 in place. The next time you press mod+Shift+s, your workspaces will be swapped among
   your monitors.
