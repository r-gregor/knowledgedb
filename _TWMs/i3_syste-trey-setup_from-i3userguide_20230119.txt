5.8. Tray output
i3bar by default provides a system tray area where programs such as NetworkManager, VLC, Pidgin, etc. can
place little icons.

You can configure on which output (monitor) the icons should be displayed or you can turn off the
functionality entirely.

You can use multiple tray_output directives in your config to specify a list of outputs on which you want
the tray to appear. The first available output in that list as defined by the order of the directives will
be used for the tray output.

Syntax:
	tray_output none|primary|<output>

Example:
	# disable system tray
	bar {
		tray_output none
	}

	# show tray icons on the primary monitor
	bar {
		tray_output primary
	}

	# show tray icons on the big monitor
	bar {
		tray_output HDMI2
	}

Note that you might not have a primary output configured yet. To do so, run:
$> xrandr --output <output> --primary

Note that when you use multiple bar configuration blocks, either specify tray_output primary in all of them
or explicitly specify tray_output none in bars which should not display the tray, otherwise the different
instances might race each other in trying to display tray icons.

5.9. Tray padding
The tray is shown on the right-hand side of the bar. By default, a padding of 2 pixels is used for the upper,
lower and right-hand side of the tray area and between the individual icons.

Syntax:
	tray_padding <px> [px]

Example:
	# Obey Fitts's law
	tray_padding 0

5.10. Font
Specifies the font to be used in the bar. See [fonts].

Syntax:
	font <font>

Example:
	bar {
		font -misc-fixed-medium-r-normal--13-120-75-75-C-70-iso10646-1
		font pango:DejaVu Sans Mono 10
	}

5.11. Custom separator symbol
Specifies a custom symbol to be used for the separator as opposed to the vertical, one pixel thick separator.

Syntax:
	separator_symbol <symbol>

Example:
	bar {
		separator_symbol ":|:"
	}

5.12. Workspace buttons
Specifies whether workspace buttons should be shown or not. This is useful if you want to display a
statusline-only bar containing additional information.

The default is to show workspace buttons.

Syntax:
	workspace_buttons yes|no

Example:
	bar {
		workspace_buttons no
	}
