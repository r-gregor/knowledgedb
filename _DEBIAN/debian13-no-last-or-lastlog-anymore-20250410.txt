 What the Kukuk? Debian 13 no last per default anymore: GNU Linux show last logged in users: last or lastlog
07.Apr.2025

   no the user is not insane, there really was a command named "last" which displays the last logged in
   users or the last boots and reboots was removed from Debian13 and replaced by entirely different
   program that needs to be installed manually

   in a post systemd world, still using "service ssh status" to check the status of the ssh service

   and then systemctrl stop ssh; systemctrl disable ssh;

   so a combination of old and new just because relearning "how to do this and that" already learned
   things is additional effort

   (renaming things and redesigning guis with every new version is the way M$ drives it's users insane
   with every paid update)

# Debian12

$> ll /usr/bin/last
/usr/bin/last -> wtmpdb; # which is a softlink to /usr/bin/wtmpdb

   wtmpdb - display login, logout and reboot information (Debian package tracker)
   there is no /var/log/lastlog file anymore

   "lastlog2 binary will replace lastlog and allows to import that old /var/log/lastlog file, to
   maintain the data and of course to show the last login data."

"Were other alternatives evaluated?"
   "Yes, but in the end, sqlite was the most widespread, robust, well maintained database library
   available today."

Why the strange naming?
   wtmp = water temperature?
     * utmp maintains a full accounting of the current status of the system
          + utmp.man.txt
          + system boot time (used by uptime)
          + recording user logins at which terminals
          + logouts
          + system events etc.
     * wtmp acts as a historical utmp
          + wtmp.man.txt (same manpage as utmp.man.txt)
     * btmp records failed login attempts (src: Wiki)
          + (no man entry for btmp)

   "names utmp and wtmp go all the way back to earliest days of UNIX in the 1970's"

   "Both files existed in UNIX v6, where the ac and who commands would report on their
   contents. (Curiously the who command would report "cannot open wtmp" if /etc/utmp was
   unreadable"

   "Initially utmp was in /etc and wtmp was in /usr/adm/wtmp"

   "Both files were moved under /var when that was split from /usr in the 1980's, at first into /var/adm
   and later into /var/log"

   "To be sure why those names were chosen you'd have to ask Ken Thompson, or search through Dennis
   Richie's archive"

   "suspect that /etc/utmp was created first and the others names were based on it. Being in /etc where
   everything else was static may have contributed to using tmp for a file that was created anew each
   time the system is booted. Or perhaps it was a temporary idea that caught on, and kept its quixotic
   filename"
