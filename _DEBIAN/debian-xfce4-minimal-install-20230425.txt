Debian Xfce4 Minimal Install Guide

   The standard Debian installation process for Xfce desktop includes additional packages that may not
   be necessary for many users. This guide will allow you to install a minimal Xfce desktop, adding
   additional packages as needed.

Requirements
     * A debian installation (hardware or virtual machine) with appropriate video drivers.
     * sudo privileges to install packages and run optional install script.
     * Installation of git to clone this repo sudo pkg install git
     * Installation of bash to run install script sudo pkg install bash

ISO for Installing Debian
     * https://cdimage.debian.org/debian-cd/current/amd64/iso-cd/debian-11.2.0-amd64-netinst.iso
     * https://www.debian.org/releases/bullseye/debian-installer/ - Installing Debian 11.2
     * https://www.debian.org/releases/bullseye/ - Debian "bullseye" Release Information

Installing Debian without a desktop environment
   As you progress through the debian installation, towards the end you will be presented with the
   following screen for Software selection:

   Uncheck Debian desktop environment to install a minimal debian system.

Update sources to testing or unstable (optional)
   Update sources to bookworm. The current testing branch.

$> sudo nano /etc/apt/sources:
deb http://deb.debian.org/debian bookworm main
deb-src http://deb.debian.org/debian bookworm main

deb http://deb.debian.org/debian-security/ bookworm-security main
deb-src http://deb.debian.org/debian-security/ bookworm-security main

deb http://deb.debian.org/debian bookworm-updates main
deb-src http://deb.debian.org/debian bookworm-updates main

# deb http://deb.debian.org/debian bookworm-backports main
# deb-src http://deb.debian.org/debian bookworm-backports main

   Add contrib non-free after each main entry if you need special drivers or additional firmware.

   The other option would be debian sid. Update sources as follows:
deb http://deb.debian.org/debian/ unstable main
deb-src http://deb.debian.org/debian/ unstable main

   Upgrade your system:
$> sudo apt update && apt upgrade

   Reboot to load updated kernel and services.

Quick install Xfce and required packages
$> git clone https://github.com/coonrad/Debian-Xfce4-Minimal-Install.git
$> cd Debian-Xfce4-Minimal-Install
$> sudo ./xfce-install.sh

Manually install Xfce and required packages
   If you've read this far, and you're getting impatient:
$> sudo apt install xfce4

   This will give you a basic Xfce desktop with lightdm greeter. For additional plugins and ''goodies',
   add:
$> sudo apt install xfce4-goodies

   This still may include too much 'stuff' for the minimalists among us. In that case, strip it down
   further and start with:
$> apt install \
    libxfce4ui-utils \
    thunar \
    xfce4-appfinder \
    xfce4-panel \
    xfce4-session \
    xfce4-settings \
    xfce4-terminal \
    xfconf \
    xfdesktop4 \
    xfwm4

   From this point you should have a working Xfce desktop environment. You can reboot, and add only what
   you need going forward.

Additional packages and configuration
   Add a browser, password manager, document viewer, image viewer and office apps:
$> sudo apt install firefox-esr keepassxc atril ristretto libreoffice-gtk3 \
libreoffice-calc libreoffice-writer

   Add NetworkManager and openvpn:
$> sudo apt install network-manager-openvpn network-manager-gnome \
network-manager-openvpn-gnome

   Add a few nice icon themes to choose from:
$> sudo apt install paper-icon-theme moka-icon-theme papirus-icon-theme

   Keep the default Adwaita theme as scientists have proven it is the best theme. Xfce comes with
   Lightdm for the display manager. It sources .xessionrc on login. Here are a few useful additions:
# source the system profile
# if [ -f /etc/profile ]; then
#	. /etc/profile
# fi

# QT5 qt5ct
export QT_QPA_PLATFORMTHEME=qt5ct

# QT5 scaling
# Uncomment for hidpi display
# export QT_AUTO_SCREEN_SCALE_FACTOR=1
# export QT_SCREEN_SCALE_FACTORS=2

   Install qt5ct and adwaita-qt to have your QT apps match the default GTK theme.
$> sudo apt install qt5ct adwaita-qt

   Launch qt5ct and configure the theme and fonts.
