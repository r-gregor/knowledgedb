How to enable Debian 12 Backports repository
May 11, 2024

The Debian Linux 12 backports repository offers updated versions of software packages for Debian Stable
releases. These packages are sourced from Testing (and sometimes Unstable) branches of Debian, and then
optimized and recompiled to function on the current Stable release, such as Bookworm. Let us see how to
install and use Debian Linux 12 "Bookworm" Backports repository.

You need to create a new repo file in the /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ directory using a text editor:
$> sudo vim /etc/apt/sources.list.d/debian-12-backports.list

Append the following config line:
deb http://deb.debian.org/debian bookworm-backports main

Save and close the file. Update package repo and list, type:
$> sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade

To install backported package, type apt command:
$> sudo apt install -t bookworm-backports {pkg_name}

If you need contrib and firemware backported packages update the
/etc/apt/sources.list.d/debian-12-backports.list as follows:
deb http://deb.debian.org/debian bookworm-backports main contrib non-free-firmware

Then update the repo:
$> sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade

How do I search packages in Debian 12 Backports repository?
You can use the apt search command as follows if you know package
name. For example:
$> apt search package-name

# say pkg name is 'xdiskusage', then: #
$> apt search xdiskusage

Outputs:

Sorting... Done
Full Text Search... Done
xdiskusage/stable-backports 1.60-4~bpo12+1 amd64
Displays a graphic of your disk usage with du

You can also use the apt-cache command as follows when you know package names:
$> apt-cache search -t bookworm-backports {pkg_name_here}
$> apt-cache search -t bookworm-backports xdiskusage
$> apt-cache search -t bookworm-backports python3-omemo-dr

Listing all available packages in Debian Linux 12 backports
Of course, you can search and list all packages using combination of the apt command and grep command/egrep
command as follows:
$> apt search . | grep -E 'bpo12|stable-backports'
$> apt search . | grep -E 'bpo12|stable-backports' | less

You can easily count all packages using the wc -l command and then print it using the printf command or echo
command:
$> apt search . | grep -E 'bpo12|stable-backports' > /tmp/list.txt
$> wc -l /tmp/list.txt
$> echo "Total packages in backport repo : $(apt search . | grep -E 'bpo12|stable-backports' | wc -l)"

Outputs:

Total packages in backport repo : 322

Searching for a specific package among all Debian Linux 12 backports
Again, the syntax is same but you need to use the grep command. Let us search for all python packages from
backports:
$> apt search . | grep -E 'bpo12|stable-backports' | grep -i python

Outputs (note bpo12 means backpors 12):

libqgispython3.28.12/stable-backports 3.28.12+dfsg-1~bpo12+1 amd64
libqgispython3.28.13/stable-backports 3.28.13+dfsg-1~bpo12+1 amd64
libqgispython3.28.14/stable-backports 3.28.14+dfsg-1~bpo12+1 amd64

python3-sphinx-design/stable-backports 0.5.0-2~bpo12+1 all
python3-varlink/stable-backports 31.0.0-2~bpo12+1 all

So what does the python3-omemo-dr package do? Let us find out:
$> apt info -a python3-omemo-dr

Outputs:

	port of libaxolotol-android. The library is defined as a ratcheting
	forward secrecy protocol that works in synchronous and asynchronous
	messaging environments.

Installing packages from backports repo Simply use any one of the following syntax:
$> sudo apt install <package>/bookworm-backports
$> sudo apt-get install <package>/bookworm-backports
$> sudo apt install -t bookworm-backports <package>
$> sudo apt-get install -t bookworm-backports <package>

Here is how to install python3-omemo-dr:
$> apt install -t bookworm-backports python3-omemo-dr

OR

$> apt-get install -t bookworm-backports python3-omemo-dr

Listing all installed packages from backports repo only
Use any one of the following command:
$> dpkg --list | grep bpo12
$> dpkg --list | grep -E 'bpo12|backports'
$> apt list --installed | grep bpo12
$> apt list --installed | grep -E 'bpo12|backports'

Outputs:

ii  python3-omemo-dr    1.0.1-2~bpo12+1       amd64    OMEMO double ratchet for Python

Deleting packages installed from backports repo
Use the following syntax to delete the package:
$> sudo apt remove python3-omemo-dr
## OR ##
$> sudo apt-get remove python3-omemo-dr

Want to get rid of config files too?
$> sudo apt --purge remove python3-omemo-dr
## OR ##
$> sudo apt-get --purge remove python3-omemo-dr

You can use the df command or du command to verify used Linux disk space when you add or remove packages:
$> df -H

Wrapping up
Now you know how to enable, install and search Debian 12 Backports packages. Please noete that Backports aims
to provide access to new software features and updates while maintaining Debian's stable and well-tested base.

The package source is primarily taken from Debian Testing, with the rare exception of coming from Unstable for
security updates.

Backported packages are precisely adjusted to work with the libraries and dependencies available in Debian
Stable to ensure compatibility

You can selectively install individual backported packages or configure your system to prioritize Backports
for specific software. For more info see the Debian wiki page here and read the following manual pages using
the help command or man command:
$> man apt
$> man apt-get
$> man apt-cache
