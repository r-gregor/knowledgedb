How to Use PipeWire to replace PulseAudio in Ubuntu 22.04
February 4, 2024

   Ubuntu 22.04 has better support for the low latency PipeWire multimedia framework. Here's how to
   setup it for PulseAudio, ALSA, JACK and Bluetooth output.

   Firstly, Pipewire is pre-installed out-of-the-box, and runs as background service automatically. You
   may check it out by running command below in terminal:
$> systemctl --user status pipewire pipewire-session-manager

   IMPORTANT: This is NOT officially supported by Ubuntu so far. It still may not work on some devices.
   Don't do it on production machine!

Step 1: install client libraries
   Though available out-of-the-box, it's not in use by default for audio output. To get start, first
   press Ctrl+Alt+T on keyboard to open terminal, and run command to install client libraries:
$> sudo apt install pipewire-audio-client-libraries libspa-0.2-bluetooth libspa-0.2-jack

Step 2: install wireplumber to replace pipewire-media-session
   The project maintainer now recommends more advanced "wireplumber" session manager when to use
   Pipewire as system sound server.

   To install the package and remove "pipewire-media-session", run the command below in terminal:
$> sudo apt install wireplumber pipewire-media-session-

   NOTE: there's a '-' in the end of the command indicates to remove the package. The command will also
   install the required pipewire-pulse automatically

Step 3: Copy configuration files:
   wireplumber makes things quite easy! If you just want to replace PulseAudio with Pipewire, enable the
   media session service and restart and that's all!!

   For ALSA clients to be configured to output via PipeWire, run command to copy the configure file:
$> sudo cp /usr/share/doc/pipewire/examples/alsa.conf.d/99-pipewire-default.conf /etc/alsa/conf.d/

   For JACK client, run command:
$> sudo cp /usr/share/doc/pipewire/examples/ld.so.conf.d/pipewire-jack-*.conf /etc/ld.so.conf.d/

   And then sudo ldconfig.

   For Bluetooth, just remove the pulseaudio-module-bluetooth package via command:
$> sudo apt remove pulseaudio-module-bluetooth

   And, finally enable the media session by running command:
$> systemctl --user --now enable wireplumber.service

Step 4: Verify
   After restarted Ubuntu 22.04, run the command below in terminal.
$> pactl info

   It should output Sound server: PulseAudio (on PipeWire x.x.x) indicates Pipewire is in use as sound
   output.

How to Restore:
   To undo the changes, firstly remove the client libraries via command:
$> sudo apt remove pipewire-audio-client-libraries libspa-0.2-bluetooth libspa-0.2-jack

   Remove wireplumber and install back the previous media session package (there's also '-' in the end):
$> sudo apt install pipewire-media-session wireplumber-

   Finally, re-enable pipewire-media-session service by running commands:
$> rm -f ~/.config/systemd/user/pipewire-session-manager.service
$> systemctl --user --now enable pipewire-media-session

   Thanks to @lestcape, if sound's still not working, try to disable pipewire-pulse services via
   command:
$> systemctl --user --now disable pipewire-pulse.service pipewire-pulse.socket

   If you tried to enabled it globally, also disable it via command:
$> sudo systemctl --global --now disable pipewire-pulse.service pipewire-pulse.socket

   And re-enable the original pulseaudio service via command:
$> systemctl --user --now reenable pulseaudio.service pulseaudio.socket
$> sudo systemctl --global --now reenable pulseaudio.service pulseaudio.socket
