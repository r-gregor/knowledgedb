How to upgrade Debian Wheezy to Jessie safely

   This tutorial explains the upgrade procedure to upgrade Debian from Wheezy to Jessie in a few simple
   steps.

   Before you start with the upgrade, backup all critical data. Thats especially the config data in the
   /etc directory and the user data in /home. When you run a server then you should include the
   databases (MySQL, Postgresql, etc), web and email data in the backup as well. The backup should be
   stored on a external harddisk, on an external server e.g. by FTP or on a cloud drive. Here are a few
   examples on how to create backups with tar.

Backup the configuration and data

   Configuration files in the /etc directory.

   tar -pczf etc.tar.gz /etc

   Backup of the /var/www website directory.

   tar -pczf www.tar.gz /var/www

   Backup of the /home directories.

   tar -pczf home.tar.gz /home

   For ISPConfig 3 users: Backup of your email server files.

   tar -pczf vmail.tar.gz /var/vmail

   Backup MySQL databases

   mysqldump --defaults-file=/etc/mysql/debian.cnf -cCeQ --hex-blob --quote-names --routines --events
   --triggers --all-databases -r all_databases.sql

   Then move the tar.gz and .sql files for safe storage on a backup drive.


Check the apt sources.list file

   We will install all available Wheezy updates first before we upgrade to Jessie. On some systems the
   package source is defined as "stable" in the sources.list file instead of "wheezy" or "jessie". To
   avoid an accidential early upgrade to Jessie, please check the sources.list now and ensure that it
   contains "wheezy" and not "stable" as source:

   Use a commandline editor like nano or vi to open /etc/apt/sources.list, the lines should be similar
   to the ones below:

   nano /etc/apt/sources.list
deb http://ftp.de.debian.org/debian wheezy main contrib non-free
deb-src http://ftp.de.debian.org/debian wheezy main contrib non-free
deb http://ftp.de.debian.org/debian wheezy-updates main contrib non-free
deb http://ftp.de.debian.org/debian-security wheezy/updates main contrib non-free

   Your country code is most likely not "de", you should use the code of your country here. Using your
   country code in the file will speed up the package download.


Update the packages for Wheezy

   The following commands will install all pending Wheezy updates. This ensures that your system is in a
   good shape for the update to Jessie.

   apt-get update

   Ready for first upgrade:

   apt-get upgrade

   Follow this with:

   apt-get dist-upgrade


Check the package state to ensure that no packages are on hold or in half installed state

   This test is important, we will check the package state to ensure that no packages are on hold or in
   half installed state. Your system and apt database must be in a good shape before we proceed with the
   dist upgrade. If there are any broken or "on hold" packages, then fix these issues before
   the upgrade.

   Check that no packages are on hold by querying the package database with the dpkg command:

   dpkg --audit
   dpkg --get-selections | grep hold

   When both commands did not return any packages, then proceed with the upgrade.


Update the sources.list for Jessie

   Edit the /etc/apt/sources.list file again:

   nano /etc/apt/sources.list

   and replace its content with the following lines:
deb http://ftp.de.debian.org/debian/ jessie main contrib non-free
deb-src http://ftp.de.debian.org/debian/ jessie main contrib non-free

deb http://httpredir.debian.org/debian jessie-updates main contrib non-free
deb-src http://httpredir.debian.org/debian jessie-updates main contrib non-free

deb http://security.debian.org/ jessie/updates main contrib non-free
deb-src http://security.debian.org/ jessie/updates main contrib non-free

   Choose your nearest locale by replacing "de" with e.g. "us" or your country code. Then save the file
   and run the following command to update the sources database:

   apt-get update


Jessie Upgrade in two steps

   It is recommended to do the upgrade in two steps, first run "apt-get upgrade" to install the base
   packages and then run "apt-get dist-upgrade" to do the actual distribution upgrade,

   Start with the update by running this command:

   apt-get upgrade

   Next we will do the distribution upgrade by running:

   apt-get dist-upgrade

   A reboot is required to finish the upgrade and load the new kernel:

   reboot

Check the update

   To check which Debian version is currently installed on the system, take a look at the file
   /etc/os-release.

   cat /etc/os-release

   The result on an Debian Jessie system is:
