Creating Debian/Ubuntu .deb packages

   In this blog post, we will guide you on how to create a .deb package for Debian/Ubuntu systems from
   binary files. With a .deb package, you can easily install and manage software on your system.

   Step 1: Create the directories
   To begin, let's start with creating the necessary directories. You will need to create a directory
   for your package and a sub-directory called DEBIAN. You can do this by running the following command
   in your terminal:
$> mkdir helloworld && mkdir helloworld/DEBIAN

   Step 2: Copy files into your package
   Next, you can copy the binary files into your package. You should use the full paths on the
   destination filesystem when copying files. For instance, if you want to put a file in
   /usr/local/bin/, you can do so by creating the directory in your package and copying the file like
   this:
$> mkdir -p helloworld/usr/local/bin
$> cp /usr/local/bin/helloworld.sh helloworld/usr/local/bin/

   Step 3: Create the control file
   After copying the files, you will need to create a control file in the DEBIAN directory. This file
   contains important information about the package such as its name, version, maintainer, architecture,
   and a short description. You can create the control file using your favorite text editor and naming
   it 'control'. Here is an example of a basic control file:
Package: helloworld
Version: 0.2
Maintainer: King Foo
Architecture: all
Description: hello world

   These are the mandatory fields in the control file. For more options see:
   http://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-controlfields.html#s-binarycontrolfiles

   Step 4: Add a post-installation script
   Additionally, you can create a post-installation script that runs after the installation is complete.
   To do so, you can create a file named 'postinst' in the DEBIAN directory and make sure it is
   executable.

   Step 5: Create the package
   Finally, you can create the .deb package by running the following command:
$> dpkg-deb --build helloworld

   This will create a helloworld.deb file in the current directory. You can now install the package on
   any Debian/Ubuntu system using the following command:
$> dpkg -i helloworld.deb

   By following these steps, you should be able to create your own .deb packages and manage your
   software installations easily. For more advanced options and configurations, you can refer to the
   Debian policy manual.
