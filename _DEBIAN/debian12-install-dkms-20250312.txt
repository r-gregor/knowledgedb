How To Install DKMS on Debian 12

   Dynamic Kernel Module Support (DKMS) is a framework that allows kernel modules to be dynamically
   built for each kernel on your system. This powerful tool is essential for Debian 12 users who need to
   maintain external kernel modules across kernel updates. When your Linux kernel gets upgraded, DKMS
   automatically recompiles and installs these modules, ensuring they remain functional without manual
   intervention.

   This comprehensive guide will walk you through the complete process of installing DKMS on Debian 12,
   configuring it properly, and using it effectively to manage your kernel modules. Whether you're a
   system administrator managing servers or a desktop user needing specific hardware support, mastering
   DKMS will significantly enhance your Debian experience.

Understanding DKMS (Dynamic Kernel Module Support)
   DKMS, short for Dynamic Kernel Module Support, is a framework designed to simplify the management of
   kernel modules that aren't included in the mainline Linux kernel. Originally developed by Dell in
   2003, DKMS creates an infrastructure where kernel modules can be rebuilt automatically whenever a new
   kernel is installed.

   At its core, DKMS maintains a registry of module source code along with build instructions. When the
   system detects a kernel update, DKMS uses this registry to recompile the modules for the new kernel
   version. This process ensures that critical functionality remains available after kernel updates
   without requiring manual intervention.

   For Debian users, DKMS offers several significant advantages:
     * Seamless kernel updates without losing functionality from third-party modules
     * Simplified management of hardware drivers not included in the mainline kernel
     * Reduced system maintenance overhead when dealing with proprietary or custom modules
     * Consistent system behavior across kernel upgrades

   Common use cases include managing graphics drivers (NVIDIA, AMD), virtualization modules (VirtualBox,
   VMware), wireless network drivers, and specialized hardware support modules.

Prerequisites for Installing DKMS
   Before proceeding with DKMS installation on Debian 12, ensure your system meets the following
   requirements:

   System Requirements:
     * A system running Debian 12 (Bookworm)
     * At least 512MB of RAM (1GB or more recommended)
     * Sufficient disk space (minimum 5GB free space)
     * Active internet connection for downloading packages

   Required Privileges:
   DKMS installation and management require administrative privileges. You'll need sudo access or to be
   logged in as the root user. If you don't have sudo configured, you can set it up with:
$> su -
$> apt install sudo
$> usermod -aG sudo your_username

   Verify Current Installation Status:
   Before installing, check if DKMS is already present on your system:
$> dpkg -l | grep dkms

   If DKMS is installed, you'll see package information displayed.

   Update Your System:
   It's critical to ensure your system is up-to-date before installing new packages:
$> sudo apt update
$> sudo apt upgrade

   Backup Recommendations:
   While DKMS installation is generally safe, it's good practice to back up important data and
   configurations:
$> sudo cp /boot/config-$(uname -r) ~/kernel-config-backup
$> sudo cp -r /etc/dkms /etc/dkms-backup  # If /etc/dkms exists

Installation Methods Overview
   Debian 12 offers multiple approaches to install DKMS, each with its own advantages. Understanding
   these methods helps you choose the most appropriate one for your specific needs.

   APT-GET Method:
   The traditional package management command-line tool in Debian. It's stable, well-established, and
   available on all Debian systems.

   APT Method:
   A more modern interface to the package management system with enhanced user-friendly features like
   progress bars and color output. APT is the recommended method for most users.

   Aptitude Method:
   An alternative package manager with a text-based interactive interface and additional dependency
   resolution capabilities.

   For beginners to the Debian command line, here are some basics:
     * Commands are executed by typing them at the terminal prompt and pressing Enter
     * Most installation commands require prefixing with sudo to gain necessary privileges
     * Terminal commands are case-sensitive
     * Use the Tab key for auto-completion of commands and filenames

Method 1: Installing DKMS Using apt-get
   The apt-get command-line tool is the traditional package management utility in Debian systems. Here's
   how to use it to install DKMS:

   Step 1: Update Package Database
   Before installing any new package, update your package database:
$> sudo apt update

   Step 2: Install DKMS
   With the package database updated, install DKMS:

Configuring DKMS After Installation
   After installing DKMS on your Debian 12 system, proper configuration ensures optimal functionality.
   While DKMS works out-of-the-box for many use cases, understanding its configuration options allows
   you to customize its behavior.

   Basic DKMS Configuration:
   DKMS primarily operates through its configuration files located in the /etc/dkms directory. The main
   configuration file is /etc/dkms/framework.conf, which controls global DKMS behavior.

   To view the current configuration:
$> cat /etc/dkms/framework.conf

   Creating a Custom Configuration File:
   You can create or edit the framework.conf file:
$> sudo nano /etc/dkms/framework.conf

   Common parameters you might want to adjust include:
# DKMS configuration file

# dkms_autoinstall: automatically install modules for new kernels
dkms_autoinstall="true"

# verbose_level: controls output verbosity (0-3)
verbose_level=1

# sign_modules: set to "true" to enable module signing
sign_modules="false"

# source_tree: location of the kernel source tree
source_tree="/usr/src"

   Important Configuration Parameters:
    1. dkms_autoinstall: Controls whether DKMS automatically builds and installs modules for newly
       installed kernels.
    2. verbose_level: Determines how much information DKMS outputs during operations (0-3, with 3 being
       the most verbose).
    3. sign_modules: When set to "true", DKMS will attempt to sign modules for SecureBoot systems.

   Testing Your DKMS Configuration:
   After making configuration changes, test that DKMS is functioning correctly:
$> sudo dkms status

   For a more thorough test, you can check DKMS's autoinstall functionality:
$> sudo dkms autoinstall --dry-run

Using DKMS with SecureBoot Systems
   SecureBoot is a UEFI feature that ensures only trusted software can boot on your computer by
   verifying digital signatures of bootloaders and kernel modules. This security feature can create
   challenges when using DKMS, as dynamically built modules aren't signed by default.

   Understanding SecureBoot Impact on DKMS:
   With SecureBoot enabled, unsigned kernel modules cannot be loaded. Since DKMS builds modules
   dynamically, these modules need to be signed with a key that your system trusts.

   Step 1: Check SecureBoot Status
   First, verify if SecureBoot is enabled on your system:
$> mokutil --sb-state

   Step 2: Generate a Machine Owner Key (MOK)
   Create a directory to store your keys:
$> sudo mkdir -p /var/lib/shim-signed/mok/

   Generate a new key pair:
$> sudo openssl req -new -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout /var/lib/shim-signed/mok/MOK.priv -outform DER -out \
	/var/lib/shim-signed/mok/MOK.der -nodes -days 36500 -subj "/CN=DKMS signing key for $(hostname)/"

   Step 3: Enroll Your MOK
   Register your key with the UEFI firmware:
$> sudo mokutil --import /var/lib/shim-signed/mok/MOK.der

   You'll be prompted to create a one-time password. Remember this password as you'll need it during the
   next boot.

   Restart your system:
$> sudo reboot

   During boot, select "Enroll MOK" and follow the prompts to complete the key enrollment.

   Step 4: Configure DKMS to Sign Modules
   Create or edit the DKMS configuration file:
$> sudo nano /etc/dkms/framework.conf

   Add the following lines:
sign_file="/usr/lib/linux-kbuild-$(uname -r)/scripts/sign-file"
signature_algorithm="sha512"
mok_key_file="/var/lib/shim-signed/mok/MOK.priv"
mok_certificate="/var/lib/shim-signed/mok/MOK.der"
sign_modules="true"

Managing DKMS Modules
   After installing DKMS on Debian 12, understanding how to effectively manage modules is essential for
   maintaining your system.

   Adding Modules to DKMS
   To add a module to DKMS, you need the module source code and a dkms.conf file. Most packages that
   support DKMS handle this automatically, but for manual addition:
    1. Place the module source in /usr/src/module-name-version/
    2. Create a dkms.conf file in the module directory
    3. Register the module with DKMS:
$> sudo dkms add -m example-module -v 1.0

   Building Modules with DKMS
   Once a module is added, build it for the current kernel:
$> sudo dkms build -m example-module -v 1.0

   Installing Modules with DKMS
   After successful building, install the module:
$> sudo dkms install -m example-module -v 1.0

   For convenience, you can combine the add, build, and install steps:
$> sudo dkms install -m example-module -v 1.0 --force

   Listing Currently Managed Modules
   To view all modules currently managed by DKMS:
$> sudo dkms status

   Removing Modules from DKMS
   To remove a module from a specific kernel:
$> sudo dkms remove -m example-module -v 1.0 -k $(uname -r)

   To remove a module from all kernels:
$> sudo dkms remove -m example-module -v 1.0 --all

DKMS and Kernel Updates
   One of DKMS's primary strengths is its ability to seamlessly manage kernel modules during kernel
   updates. This ensures that hardware functionality and system features dependent on these modules
   remain available after upgrading.

   Automatic Module Rebuilding
   By default, DKMS is configured to automatically rebuild and install modules when a new kernel is
   installed on your Debian 12 system. This process occurs through integration with Debian's kernel
   package management:
    1. When a new kernel is installed, the kernel package triggers DKMS via hooks
    2. DKMS identifies all registered modules
    3. Each module is built for the new kernel
    4. Successfully built modules are installed for the new kernel

   Manual Rebuilding When Necessary
   There are situations where you might need to manually trigger module rebuilding:
    1. If automatic rebuilding failed during a kernel update
    2. After manually installing a kernel
    3. When installing a new DKMS module for existing kernels

   To manually rebuild all DKMS modules for the current kernel:
$> sudo dkms autoinstall

   Troubleshooting Module Rebuilding Issues
   Common issues during module rebuilding include:
    1. Missing Kernel Headers:
$> sudo apt install linux-headers-$(uname -r)

    2. Build Tool Issues:
$> sudo apt install build-essential

    3. Module Source Problems:
$> sudo cat /var/lib/dkms/module_name/module_version/build/make.log

   Best Practices for Kernel Updates with DKMS
   To ensure smooth kernel transitions with DKMS:
    1. Always keep kernel headers installed for your running kernels
    2. Don't remove old kernels immediately after updates until you've verified all DKMS modules work
       with the new kernel
    3. Before critical kernel updates, check DKMS module status

Uninstalling DKMS
   There may be situations where you need to remove DKMS from your Debian 12 system. This section covers
   various methods to uninstall DKMS, from basic removal to complete purging.

   Method 1: Removing Only the DKMS Package
   To remove the DKMS package while keeping configuration files:
$> sudo apt remove dkms

   Method 2: Removing DKMS and Its Dependencies
   To remove DKMS along with packages that were automatically installed to satisfy its dependencies:
$> sudo apt autoremove dkms

   Method 3: Purging DKMS Configurations and Data
   For a more thorough removal that includes configuration files:
$> sudo apt purge dkms

   Method 4: Complete Removal of DKMS and Related Components
   For a comprehensive cleanup of DKMS and related files:
$> sudo apt purge dkms
$> sudo apt autoremove --purge
$> sudo rm -rf /var/lib/dkms

   Before Uninstalling DKMS
   Before removing DKMS, consider:
    1. Identifying DKMS-managed modules
    2. Backing up module sources if needed
    3. Researching alternative installation methods for critical modules

Common Issues and Troubleshooting
   Even with careful installation and configuration, DKMS users on Debian 12 may encounter various
   issues. This section addresses common problems and provides practical solutions.

   Failed Module Builds
   When DKMS fails to build a module, several issues might be responsible:
    1. Missing Build Dependencies:
$> sudo apt install build-essential linux-headers-$(uname -r)

    2. Incompatible Module Source:
       Check the error log:
$> sudo cat /var/lib/dkms/module_name/version/build/make.log

    3. Syntax or Source Code Issues:
       You might need to apply patches:
$> cd /usr/src/module-name-version/
$> sudo patch -p1 < ~/downloaded-patch.patch

   Module Loading Issues
   If modules build successfully but fail to load:
    1. Module Signature Issues (SecureBoot):
$> sudo mokutil --sb-state
$> modinfo module_name | grep -i signature

    2. Module Parameters:
       Some modules require specific parameters to load correctly.
    3. Blacklisted Modules:
$> grep -r "blacklist module_name" /etc/modprobe.d/

   Logging and Debugging DKMS Operations
   For troubleshooting complex issues:
    1. Enable Verbose Output:
$> sudo dkms build -m module_name -v version --verbose

    2. Examine Kernel Logs:
$> sudo dmesg | grep module_name

    3. Check DKMS Logs:
$> sudo ls -la /var/lib/dkms/module_name/version/build/
$> sudo cat /var/lib/dkms/module_name/version/build/make.log

Practical Examples of DKMS Usage
   DKMS truly demonstrates its value in real-world scenarios where kernel modules need to be maintained
   across system updates.

   Managing VirtualBox Guest Additions
   VirtualBox Guest Additions provide enhanced functionality when running Debian as a virtual machine:
$> sudo apt install virtualbox-guest-dkms

   After kernel updates, the modules automatically rebuild, maintaining seamless clipboard sharing,
   display resizing, and improved performance.

   Graphics Driver Modules
   Many graphics cards, particularly NVIDIA GPUs, require proprietary drivers:
$> sudo apt install nvidia-driver nvidia-kernel-dkms

   When the kernel updates, the NVIDIA modules rebuild automatically, maintaining graphics performance
   without requiring manual reinstallation of drivers.

   Wireless Network Driver Modules
   Some wireless adapters require drivers not included in the mainline kernel:
$> sudo apt install rtl8812au-dkms  # For Realtek RTL8812AU adapters
$> sudo apt install broadcom-sta-dkms  # For Broadcom wireless chips

   DKMS ensures these drivers remain functional after kernel updates, maintaining wireless connectivity
   without user intervention.
